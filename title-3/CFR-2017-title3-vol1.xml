    <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
    <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
    <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
    <IPAR>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
      <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
      <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
      <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
      <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
      <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
    </IPAR>
    <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
      <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
      <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
      <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

      <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
      <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
      <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
    </SIDEHED>
    <SIDEHED>
      <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
      <P>
        <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
      <P>
        <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
      <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
      <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
      <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
      <P>
        <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation of This Title</HD>
    <P>This volume of “Title 3—The President” contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>

    <P>The 2016 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E> Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.</P>

    <P>Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>.</P>
    <P>Presidential documents in this volume may be cited “3 CFR, 2016 Comp.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 9388 appearing on page 1 of this book, is “3 CFR, 2016 Comp., p. 1.” Chapter I entries may be cited “3 CFR.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is “3 CFR 100.1.”</P>
    <P>This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2017, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.</P>

    <P>For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled <E T="03">Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover</E> (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the <E T="03">Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders</E> (April 13, 1945—January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the <E T="03">Compilation of Presidential Documents</E> and the <E T="03">Public Papers of the Presidents</E> series. A selection of these Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Publishing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity ActBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>1. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, the President designated the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “1974 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) (AGOA).</FP>
  <FP>2. Sections 506A(d)(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(d)(4)(C)) and 506A(c)(1) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(c)(1)) of the 1974 Act authorize the President to suspend the application of duty-free treatment provided for any article described in section 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(b)(1)) or 19 U.S.C. 3721 with respect to a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if he determines that the beneficiary country is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending such duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting compliance by the country with those requirements than terminating the designation of the country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act.</FP>

  <FP>3. Pursuant to section 506A(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that South Africa is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending the application of duty-free <PRTPAGE P="2"/>treatment to certain goods would be more effective in promoting compliance by South Africa with such requirements than terminating the designation of South Africa as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. Accordingly, I have decided to suspend the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector from South Africa for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016.</FP>
  <FP>4. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 506A(d)(4)(C), 506A(c)(1), and 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:</FP>
  <P>(1) The application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector from South Africa is suspended for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016.</P>
  <P>(2) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning on March 15, 2016, the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector from South Africa shall be suspended, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.</P>
  <P>(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.BARACK OBAMA</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9389</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Religious Freedom Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our country's founding, religious freedom has been heralded as one of our most cherished ideals. The right to practice religion freely has brought immigrants from all over the world to our shores, often in the face of great adversity, so they could live their lives in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. Some of America's earliest settlers, the Pilgrims, arrived at our shores in search of a more tolerant society, free from religious persecution. Since that time, people of many religious traditions have added their own threads to the fabric of our Nation, helping advance a profound and continuous vindication of the idea of America.</FP>
  <FP>When the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was adopted on January 16, 1786, it formed a blueprint for what would become the basis for the protection of religious liberty enshrined in our Constitution. Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the statute proclaims that “all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.” The First Amendment prohibits Government from establishing religion, and it protects the free exercise of every faith. Our Government does not sponsor a religion, nor does it pressure anyone to practice a particular faith, or any faith at all. The United States stands for the protection of equal rights for all people to practice their faith freely, without fear or coercion, and as Americans, we understand that when people of all religions are accepted and are full and equal members of our society, we are all stronger and freer.</FP>
  <FP>Our commitment to religious freedom has fostered unprecedented religious diversity and freedom of religious practice. But these ideals are not self-executing. Rather, they require a sustained commitment by each generation to uphold and preserve them. Here at home, my Administration is working to preserve religious liberty and enforce civil rights laws that protect religious freedom—including laws that protect employees from religious discrimination and require reasonable accommodation of religious practices on the job. We will keep upholding the right of religious communities to establish places of worship and protecting the religious rights of those so often forgotten by society, such as incarcerated persons and individuals confined to institutions. We will also continue to protect students from discrimination and harassment that is based on their faith, and we will continue to enforce hate crime laws, including those perpetrated based on a person's actual or perceived religion. This work is crucial, particularly given the recent spike in reports of threats and violence against houses of worship, children, and adults simply because of their religious affiliation.</FP>

  <FP>As we strive to uphold religious freedom at home, we recognize that this basic element of human dignity does not stop at our shores, and we work to promote religious freedom around the globe. We are working with a broad coalition against those who have subjected religious minorities to unspeakable violence and persecution, and we are mobilizing religious and civic leaders to defend vulnerable religious communities. In addition, we <PRTPAGE P="12"/>are calling for the elimination of improper restrictions that suppress religious practice, coordinating with governments around the world to promote religious freedom for citizens of every faith, and expanding training for our diplomats on how to monitor and advocate for this freedom. All people deserve the fundamental dignity of practicing their faith free from fear, intimidation, and violence.</FP>
  <FP>On Religious Freedom Day, let us recommit ourselves to protecting religious minorities here at home and around the world. May we remember those who have been persecuted, tortured, or murdered for their faith and reject any politics that targets people because of their religion, including any suggestion that our laws, policies, or practices should single out certain faiths for disfavored treatment. And as one Nation, let us state clearly and without equivocation that an attack on any faith is an attack on every faith and come together to promote religious freedom for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2016 as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation of our Nation's liberty, and that show us how we can protect it for future generations at home and around the world.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.BARACK  OBAMA</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>With profound faith in our Nation's promise, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a non-violent movement that urged our country's leaders to expand the reach of freedom and provide equal opportunity for all. Dr. King joined a long line of heroes and vindicated the belief at the heart of our founding: that humble citizens, armed with little but faith, can come together to change the world and remake an America that more closely aligns with our highest ideals.</FP>

  <FP>Dr. King recognized that, as a country built on the foundation of self-governance, our success rested on engaging ordinary citizens in the work of securing our birthright liberties. Together, with countless unsung heroes equally committed to the idea that America is a constant work in progress, he heeded the call etched into our founding documents nearly two centuries before his time, marching and sacrificing for the idea of a fair, just, and inclusive society. By preaching his dream of a day when his children would be judged by the content of their character—rather than by the color of their skin—he helped awaken our Nation to the bitter truth that basic <PRTPAGE P="13"/>justice for all had not yet been realized. And in his efforts, he peaceably yet forcefully demonstrated that it is not enough to only have equal protection under the law, but also that equal opportunity for all of our Nation's children is necessary so that they can shape their own destinies.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we celebrate the long arc of progress for which Dr. King and so many other leaders fought to bend toward a brighter day. It is our mission to fulfill his vision of a Nation devoted to rejecting bigotry in all its forms; to rising above cynicism and the belief that we cannot change; and to cherishing dignity and opportunity not only for our own daughters and sons, but also for our neighbors' children.</FP>
  <FP>We have made great advances since Dr. King's time, yet injustice remains in many corners of our country. In too many communities, the cycle of poverty persists and students attend schools without adequate resources—some that serve as a pipeline to prison for young people of color. Children still go to bed hungry, and the sick go without sufficient treatment in neighborhoods across America. To put up blinders to these realities or to intimate that they are inherent to a Nation as large and diverse as ours would do a disservice to those who fought so hard to ensure ours was a country dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal.</FP>
  <FP>“We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now,” Dr. King once said. As the most diverse country on Earth, ensuring this creed is reflected in our hearts, minds, and policies is the imperative of our citizenship. As Americans of all races and beliefs come together on this day of service to honor the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let us pledge to recognize the common humanity of all people, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2016, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">American Heart Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Affecting people of all races and ethnicities, cardiovascular disease is the single leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, responsible for one in three deaths in the United States each year. <PRTPAGE P="14"/>Though usually preventable, heart disease can manifest itself in sudden and unforeseen ways, and it costs our Nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. During American Heart Month, we remember those we have lost to this devastating disease, promote healthy lifestyles that mitigate its impacts, and pledge to continue our fight against it.</FP>
  <FP>Heart disease must be addressed with urgency. Every person can take steps to reduce the risk factors associated with heart disease in themselves and in those they care about—whether as parents, caretakers, or friends—by encouraging healthy eating, physical activity, and by discouraging the use of tobacco. Almost half of all Americans face increased risk of heart disease for reasons that include being a smoker, having high blood pressure, or having high cholesterol. You can reduce your chances of developing heart disease by reducing alcohol intake, exercising regularly, maintaining a nutritious diet, living tobacco-free, and staying aware of early warning signs. For more resources and information, visit www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease.</FP>

  <FP>Testing cholesterol levels for individuals particularly vulnerable to heart disease and checking blood pressure regularly are both critical preventive measures for detecting heart disease early on, and thanks to the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans now have access to recommended preventive services for free. First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative is working to reduce obesity—another primary contributing factor to cardiovascular issues—among children to offset their susceptibility to heart disease and other obesity-related health problems. Additionally, my Administration launched Million Hearts 5 years ago, a national initiative aimed at preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in research that helps target medical treatments and gives all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthy.</FP>
  <FP>Michelle and I encourage everyone to participate in National Wear Red Day on Friday, February 5, by wearing red in honor of those we have lost to heart disease and to raise awareness of this devastating disease and the steps we can all take to prevent it. Every 43 seconds, someone in the United States suffers a heart attack, and many of them are fatal. Combating heart disease is imperative for improving public health in America, and together, we can work to ensure everybody knows its signs and symptoms and can access needed care. This month, let us renew our efforts to raise awareness of this disease and its consequences, and let us recommit to building a healthier, heartier future for all.</FP>
  <FP>In acknowledgment of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as “American Heart Month.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 5, 2016. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.<PRTPAGE P="15"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National African American History Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America's greatness is a testament to generations of courageous individuals who, in the face of uncomfortable truths, accepted that the work of perfecting our Nation is unending and strived to expand the reach of freedom to all. For too long, our most basic liberties had been denied to African Americans, and today, we pay tribute to countless good-hearted citizens—along the Underground Railroad, aboard a bus in Alabama, and all across our country—who stood up and sat in to help right the wrongs of our past and extend the promise of America to all our people. During National African American History Month, we recognize these champions of justice and the sacrifices they made to bring us to this point, we honor the contributions of African Americans since our country's beginning, and we recommit to reaching for a day when no person is judged by anything but the content of their character.</FP>
  <FP>From the Revolutionary War through the abolitionist movement, to marches from Selma to Montgomery and across America today, African Americans have remained devoted to the proposition that all of us are created equal, even when their own rights were denied. As we rejoice in the victories won by men and women who believed in the idea of a just and fair America, we remember that, throughout history, our success has been driven by bold individuals who were willing to speak out and change the status quo.</FP>
  <FP>Refusing to accept our Nation's original sin, African Americans bound by the chains of slavery broke free and headed North, and many others who knew slavery was antithetical to our country's conception of human rights and dignity fought to bring their moral imagination to life. When Jim Crow mocked the advances made by the 13th Amendment, a new generation of men and women galvanized and organized with the same force of faith as their enslaved ancestors. Our Nation's young people still echo the call for equality, bringing attention to disparities that continue to plague our society in ways that mirror the non-violent tactics of the civil rights movement while adapting to modern times. Let us also not forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could make our voices heard by exercising our right to vote. Even in the face of legal challenges, every eligible voter should not take for granted what is our right to shape our democracy.</FP>

  <FP>We have made great progress on the journey toward ensuring our ideals ring true for all people. Today, African American high school graduation and college enrollment rates are at an all-time high. The African-American <PRTPAGE P="16"/>unemployment rate has been halved since its Great Recession peak. More than 2 million African Americans gained health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The incarceration rates for African-American men and women fell during each year of this Administration and are at their lowest points in over two decades. Yet challenges persist and obstacles still stand in the way of becoming the country envisioned at our founding, and we would do a disservice to all who came before us if we remained blind to the way past injustices shape the present. The United States is home to 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's prisoners—a disproportionate number of whom are African American—so we must find ways to reform our criminal justice system and ensure that it is fairer and more effective. While we've seen unemployment rates decrease, many communities, particularly those of color, continue to experience significant gaps in educational and employment opportunities, causing too many young men and women to feel like no matter how hard they try, they may never achieve their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>Our responsibility as citizens is to address the inequalities and injustices that linger, and we must secure our birthright freedoms for all people. As we mark the 40th year of National African American History Month, let us reflect on the sacrifices and contributions made by generations of African Americans, and let us resolve to continue our march toward a day when every person knows the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.BARACK  OBAMA</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Teen dating violence is a serious violation that can affect a young person's safety, development, and sense of comfort. Perpetrated by a current or past intimate partner, dating violence takes many forms, including physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, and can occur in person or through electronic communication and social media. Violent dating relationships can lead to depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol use, and thoughts of suicide, and victims may continue to experience detrimental effects throughout their lives. <PRTPAGE P="17"/>During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recognize the urgency needed in addressing this problem and recommit to preventing it by educating our youth about its dangers and consequences, and reaffirm the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse.</FP>
  <FP>Dating violence may include physical force, such as kicking, hitting, and shoving; emotional abuse, consistent monitoring, and isolation; or sexual assault. Dating violence can occur in any relationship, whether it is casual and short-term or long-term and monogamous, and any young person can experience dating violence or other unhealthy relationship behaviors—regardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. Approximately 1 in 10 teenagers reports being physically or sexually victimized by a dating partner, and too many other victims do not report it. The cycle of violence can begin with anyone at any time, and as a society, we must acknowledge that we each have a role to play in teaching children about healthy relationships. In their formative years, teens are influenced by their early relationships, and the example set by those around them can have lasting consequences.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is working diligently to address teen dating violence in a number of ways. Vice President Joe Biden's <E T="03">1is2many</E> initiative is strengthening efforts to reduce dating violence among those most vulnerable, particularly young women between the ages of 16 and 24, and is utilizing technology to engage students, teens, and young adults in this cause. To build on our efforts, I established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The Task Force will, in addition to working to combat sexual violence on college campuses, explore ways its recommendations may apply to elementary and secondary schools across our country. My Administration will keep forging a future in which no teenager must suffer due to having an abusive partner.</FP>
  <FP>All Americans have a role to play in ending dating violence and fostering safe, healthy environments for our young people. This month, let us seize our responsibility to set positive examples for our Nation's teenagers by celebrating and demonstrating healthy relationships, and let us recommit to ensuring all people who may be in an abusive relationship have access to help and support. Together, we can reach a day when no young person knows the pain caused by dating violence.</FP>
  <FP>If you or someone you know is involved in an abusive relationship of any kind, you can get immediate and confidential support by calling 1-866-331-9474, texting “LoveIs” to 22522, or visiting LoveIsRespect.org. For additional information and resources on dating violence, please visit VetoViolence.CDC.gov.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, and in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy relationships throughout their lives and to engage in activities that prevent and respond to teen dating violence.</FP>

  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the <PRTPAGE P="18"/>Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.BARACK  OBAMA</FP>
  <PROC>Proclamation 9394 of February 12, 2016</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9394</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Castle Mountains National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Castle Mountains area, bounded on three sides by Mojave National Preserve (Preserve), possesses outstanding natural, cultural, and historical values representing some of the finest characteristics of the eastern Mojave Desert. It connects water flow and wildlife corridors of the Preserve, and completes the boundary of the Preserve along the California-Nevada border. Beneath the shadow of Hart Peak lie rich cultural and historic resources, including Native American archeological sites and the historic gold mining ghost town of Hart. Exposed geologic features contribute to the area's outstanding scenery.</FP>
  <FP>Shaped by millions of years of geologic forces, the rugged Castle Mountains are emblematic of the Mojave landscape. The Castle Mountains rise from the broad sweep of the Lanfair Valley to a height of over 5,000 feet, presenting a picturesque skyline visible from many locations within the Preserve, while also affording spectacular views of the Preserve and beyond. Hart Peak is the prominent feature in the Castle Mountains skyline at 5,543 feet. Views from Hart Peak encompass vast wilderness and distinctive peaks, including Spirit Mountain in Nevada, a sacred site to many Native American tribes. The remoteness of the Castle Mountains area offers visitors the chance to experience the solitude of the desert and its increasingly rare natural soundscapes and dark night skies.</FP>
  <FP>The Castle Mountains area provides a critical linkage for plants, animals, and water between two mountain ranges within the Preserve, the New York Mountains to the northwest and the Piute Mountains to the southeast. The area's high quality desert habitat includes some of the finest Joshua tree forest in the Mojave Desert, as well as pinyon pine and juniper forest at the upper elevations. The area's native desert grassland is a hotspot of botanical diversity. The unique plant assemblage includes 28 species of native grasses, about half of which are rare, including burrograss and false buffalograss.</FP>

  <FP>Protection of this relatively intact and undisturbed habitat is important not just to the long-term survival of many plant species but also to significant wildlife populations. A herd of desert bighorn sheep lives on the steep, rocky slopes of the Castle Mountains. They and other wildlife traverse the area between the Piute Mountains and the New York Mountains. Numerous bat species live in rock crevices and mine remnants in the area. Wildlife species of special concern include the Townsend's big-eared bat, California leaf-nosed bat, Swainson's hawk, golden eagle, desert tortoise, Bendire's thrasher, and gray vireo.<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>With its habitat linkages, wildlife corridors, and intact ecosystems, the area offers exceptional opportunities to study plant and animal movement and connections between diverse natural systems, especially in the context of climate change. Ongoing studies of desert bighorn sheep and other plant and animal species have shown the priority of this area for scientific research. A recent study using network models of bighorn sheep genetic and demographic connectivity as tools for landscape-scale conservation found the Castle Mountains habitat to be one of the most important in the Mojave Desert. Botanists are finding new and rare plant populations, and significant new information regarding the range of species such as Mexican panicgrass, in the Castle Mountains area.</FP>
  <FP>The Castle Mountains area is the only remaining portion of the 226-square mile Lanfair Valley watershed that is not part of the Preserve. Underlying much of the Lanfair Valley, including the Castle Mountains area, is a large groundwater aquifer of critical importance to the desert ecosystem. With its primary recharge zone in the New York Mountains, this aquifer feeds Piute Spring, located in the Preserve just south of the Castle Mountains area. Piute Spring is the only perennial stream and riparian corridor in the Preserve, and attracts numerous flora and fauna.</FP>
  <FP>As a rare desert water source, Piute Spring attracted Native American habitation for thousands of years, followed by Euro-American exploration and settlement. Drawn to this reliable source of potable water, in 1867 the U.S. Army established Fort Piute (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) adjacent to the spring to provide protection to travelers on the Old Spanish Trail (known locally as the Mojave Road) that crossed the Mojave Desert from the Colorado River to San Bernardino, California. Maintenance of the groundwater resources and flow to Piute Spring is essential to the historical and scientific value of both the area and the Preserve.</FP>

  <FP>The Castle Mountains area also contains other cultural resources that reflect a long history of prehistoric and historic human use. Prehistoric rock art and archeological sites are found throughout the area. The rock art indicates sites of significant cultural import to both the Fort Mojave and Chemehuevi Tribes, marking routes through the Castle Mountains likely traveled by both tribes. The Castle Mountains area links places to the south, like Piute Spring, to areas north, such as an obsidian collection site. Western expansion brought ranching, mining, and the railroad to the area. Some of the best-preserved segments of a wagon road that linked the Arizona Territory (Hardyville, now Bullhead City, Arizona) to settlements in southern California can be found in the Castle Mountains area. Ranchers grazed cattle in the area. By 1894, the Rock Springs Land and Cattle Company had consolidated its holdings in the eastern Mojave Desert. Much of their historic ranch lies within the Preserve, and features of this and other grazing enterprises of the era can still be seen in the Castle Mountains area. In 1907, brothers Bert and Clark Hitt found rich gold ore, staking claims that became the Oro Belle and Big Chief Mines. With James Hart, they founded the town of Hart at the base of Hart Peak. Between 1908 and 1910, the town of Hart underwent a rapid boom and bust, and by 1920, Hart had become a ghost town. Throughout this period of western expansion, railroads served the ranchers, miners, Hart residents, and others in the eastern Mojave Desert. Part of the former 23-mile Barnwell and Searchlight Railway, later incorporated into the California Eastern Railway, ran through the Castle Mountains area.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>

  <EAR>Proc. 9395</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Mojave Trails National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Mojave Trails area of southern California is a stunning mosaic of rugged mountain ranges, ancient lava flows, and spectacular sand dunes. It is a landscape defined by scarcity and shaped by travel. The area exemplifies the remarkable ecology of the Mojave Desert, where the hearty insistence of life is scratched out from unrelenting heat and dryness. This punishing environment has also forged the unique human history of the area, from ancient settlements uprooted by a changing climate to the armies of General George S. Patton, Jr., as they trained for battle in North Africa. With historic American trading routes, trails followed by Spanish explorers, a transcontinental rail line, and the Nation's most famous highway, the Mojave Trails area tells the American story of exploration, migration, and commerce. The Mojave Trails area is an invaluable treasure and will continue to serve as an irreplaceable national resource for geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, and historians for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>The Mojave Trails area has been a focus of geological research for decades. This unique landscape contains a stunning diversity of lava flows, mountains, playas, sand dunes, bajadas, washes, and other features. The area contains a number of significant sand dune features, most notably the stunning Cadiz Dunes, which have been extensively studied. The mountains of the Mojave Trails area include several significant formations, and seismologists have studied this area for insight into faulting, tectonics, and magmatism. A number of young volcanoes and their associated lava flows in the area have been heavily studied by volcanologists. Amboy Crater, designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1973, has been the focus of research on a number of volcanic phenomena. The Pisgah Volcano lava flow's vast network of lava tubes constitutes southern California's highest density of caves, and is used by both speleologists and recreational cavers. The area's terrain and geology have provided a surrogate for lunar and Martian landscapes, and many of the robotic and imaging technologies used to better understand volcanism and Aeolian processes have been developed and tested in the Mojave Trails area.</FP>

  <FP>Outstanding paleontological resources can be found throughout the Mojave Trails area. The Cady Mountains contain important fossil fauna assemblages dating to the Miocene Period. The Marble Mountain Fossil Bed area contains one of the classic Cambrian trilobite fossil sites in the Western United States. Set in the green-brown lower Cambrian Latham Shale, the fossil beds also contain the fossilized remains of brachiopods, mollusks, echinoderms, and algal bodies that are of great interest to paleontologists. The southern Bristol Mountains contain Tertiary fossils such as camel tracks, invertebrates, and numerous plants; this fossil history has also been used to understand the climate history of the Mojave Desert. Significant vertebrate fossils and other fossil resources have also been identified in Piute Valley and Cadiz Valley as well as the Ship Mountains, Little Piute Mountains, and Sacramento Mountains.<PRTPAGE P="24"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The Mojave Trails area has been important for ecological research, including studies on the effects of climate change and land management practices on ecological communities and wildlife. It provides opportunity for further research on ecological connectivity in the Mojave Desert region, as it is among the most ecologically intact areas in southern California. The species that have managed to thrive here are specialists in perseverance and resourcefulness and are remarkable for their ability to withstand the desert extremes. The area's scarce springs and riparian areas such as Afton Canyon, Chuckwalla Spring, Hummingbird Spring, Barrel Spring, and Fenner Spring provide refuges for a wide variety of plants and animals. The complex network of groundwater underlying the Mojave Trails area has been the subject of past and ongoing hydrological study. Underground aquifers feed springs and seeps that are important for sensitive ecosystems and wildlife, though specific connections are not yet well understood.</FP>
  <FP>Rare plant species such as the scrub lotus, rosy two-tone beardtongue, whitemargin beardtongue, Emory's crucifixion-thorn, small-flowered androstephium, white-margined penstemon, and Borrego milkvetch rely on the specific habitat types found in the Mojave Trails area. The Piute Valley area in the northeastern part of the Mojave Trails area is home to the northernmost occurrences of smoke trees in the California desert, as well as the Homer Mountain Ocotillo Assemblage. The lowlands and middle elevations are also home to other unique or ecologically significant plants such as the endemic Orocopia Mountains spurge. Numerous cactus species are also found here, including the densest concentration of Bigelow cholla cactus in California. Ongoing research in the Mojave Trails area has identified other plant species that are new to science, many of which have not yet been described.</FP>
  <FP>Birds including the endangered Least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, and yellow-billed cuckoo depend on this area, as do raptors such as the burrowing owl, red-tailed hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, and prairie falcon. Fragile desert fish species such as the bonytail chub rely on the scarce waters of the desert riparian ecosystems. A wide variety of fascinating native mammal species can be found in the Mojave Trails area, including the kit fox, ringtail, American badger, mountain lion, and bighorn sheep. Reptiles and amphibians, including the Mojave Desert's largest lizard, the chuckwalla, have been extensively studied in the Mojave Trails area. The area contains some of the Mojave Desert's best habitat for the threatened desert tortoise and provides important dispersal corridors for that fragile species. An unusual community of invertebrates associated with lava tubes in the Pisgah area offers an ongoing opportunity for entomological research.</FP>

  <FP>Humans have lived in and moved through the Mojave Trails area for more than 10,000 years. The archeological record tells of a human existence shaped by a changing climate. During the Paleo-Indian period, now-dry lakes provided fresh water to small groups of nomadic people and the animals they hunted. From around 7,000 to 2,000 BC, rising temperatures resulted in a change from wet to dry conditions. Associated ecological changes in the region led to new patterns of subsistence for native peoples. Although people remained closely tied to water sources following the temperature increase, desert inhabitants adjusted their diets to rely more heavily on plants and fish, invented new tools, and expanded the sizes of their <PRTPAGE P="25"/>social groups. During the Formative Period (2,500 to 1,500 BC), dry conditions meant the inhabitants of the Mojave Desert remained in small groups. They relied heavily for their survival on the Mojave River, a name derived from the traditional name for these people, Pipa Aha Macav (“the people by the river”). The Mojave people left their mark on the landscape through petroglyphs, pictographs, old trails, and stone work, some of which can still be found today, especially near springs and rivers and along the shores of now-extinct lakes.</FP>
  <FP>The Mojave were not the only people to use or pass through this landscape. Ancestors of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, a branch of the Southern Paiute, have been persistent occupants of the Mojave Desert for thousands of years. Sacred Chemehuevi trails are often tied to traditional and ceremonial songs. The Salt Song Trail, one of the longest song trails of the Chemehuevi people, passes through the Mojave Trails area near the town of Fenner and the Ward Valley. Natural land patterns form the route of this trail, with specific songs sung at specific wayside locations. Other Native Americans who have lived in or passed through the Mojave Desert include the Shoshone, Serrano, Kawaiisu, and the Paiute. The Ward Valley, located between the Old Woman and Piute Mountains, is sacred to a number of these tribes, as are the Mesquite and Crucero Hills, which contain over 50 archaeological sites including petroglyphs, milling stations, temporary camps, intaglios, lithic scatters, and pottery dating as far back as 4,000 years.</FP>
  <FP>The Mojave Trails area has been a critical travel corridor for millennia, linking the Pacific Coast to the deserts of the southwest and beyond. The Mojave Indian Trail is the earliest known travel route passing through the Mojave Trails area, used by Native Americans for thousands of years and by early Spanish explorers and traders. In 1829, Mexican explorer Antonio Armijo pioneered the Old Spanish Trail through this area. Evidence of the trail, now designated a National Historic Trail, can still be found at Afton Canyon.</FP>
  <FP>By the end of the 19th century, transcontinental rail travel had changed the American West in profound ways. In 1882, Southern Pacific constructed a railroad route from Barstow to Needles. In addition to the major rail stops established at Needles and Barstow, several smaller towns and rail stops were established along this stretch, including the alphabetically named Amboy, Bristol, Cadiz, Danby, Essex, Fenner, and Goffs. These towns remain, some as inhabited hamlets and others as abandoned ghost towns, and some historical artifacts from the original rail line still exist, including original rail ties and track and later improvements of communications poles, insulators, and wires.</FP>

  <FP>A modest dirt road—an original trackside component of the railroad project—would later become the most famous highway in America. In 1911, in the infancy of the automobile era, the County of San Bernardino paved the first stretch of that road from Barstow to Needles. The next year, this stretch became part of the National Old Trails Road, which extended more than 3,000 miles from New York, New York, to Los Angeles, California, and connected the American coasts by pavement for the first time. In 1926, the road was officially designated as U.S. Highway 66, a designation soon known around the world as Route 66. During the 1930s, Route 66 became an important route for migrants escaping economic hardships of <PRTPAGE P="26"/>the Great Depression and droughts in the Central plains. As the national economy rebounded following World War II, Americans took to the highways in unprecedented numbers. The road became an American icon, earning the nickname the “Main Street of America” and inspiring popular culture through music, literature, and film.</FP>
  <FP>The popularity of Route 66, however, hastened its downfall; increasing traffic quickly exceeded its two-lane capacity. In 1985, Route 66 was officially decommissioned, leaving behind a powerful albeit fragmented narrative history of America's automobile culture of the first half of the 20th century and its legacy of related commerce and architecture. The Mojave Trails area contains the longest remaining undeveloped stretch of Route 66, offering spectacular and serene desert vistas and a glimpse into what travelers experienced during the peak of the route's popularity in the mid-20th century. Today, the ghost towns along this stretch of Route 66 are a visual legacy of how the automobile shaped the American landscape.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to its important role in the transportation history of the United States, the Mojave Trails area is a unique resource for understanding one of the most formative periods in American military history. During the height of World War II, the United States military recognized a need to develop a desert training program in order to prepare its troops to fight the tank armies of Nazi Germany in North Africa. Major General George S. Patton, Jr., commander of the I Armored Corps, selected the site of the Desert Training Center in the Mojave Trails area, the largest training area in the world at the time. More than one million troops trained in the area between 1942 and 1944, including at Camp Ibis, Camp Clipper, Camp Iron Mountain, Camp Granite, and Camp Essex. Remnants of these camps can still be found today, including rock-lined streets, staging areas, flag circles, altars, tent areas, and even tank tracks on some of the area's hardpan playas.</FP>
  <FP>The protection of the Mojave Trails area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>

  <PROC>Proclamation 9396 of February 12, 2016</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9396</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Sand to Snow National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Sand to Snow area of southern California is an ecological and cultural treasure, a microcosm of the great geographic diversity of the region. Rising from the floor of the Sonoran Desert to the tallest peak in southern California, the area features a remarkable diversity of plant and animal species. The area includes a portion of the San Bernardino National Forest and connects this area with Joshua Tree National Park to the east, knitting together a mosaic of spectacular landscapes stretching over 200 miles. The mountain peaks of the Sand to Snow area frame the northeastern reach of Coachella Valley along with the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument to the south. Home to desert oases at Big Morongo Canyon and Whitewater Canyon, the area serves as a refuge for desert dwelling animals and a stopover for migrating birds. The archaeological riches of the Black Lava Buttes and the historical remains of mining and ranching communities tell of past prosperity and struggle in this arid land. The unbroken expanse is an invaluable treasure for our Nation and will continue to serve as an irreplaceable resource for archaeologists, geologists, and biologists for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>The Sand to Snow area encompasses a rich diversity of geological and ecological resources, including a nearly 10,000-foot elevation gradient from the Sonoran Desert floor to the top of the 11,500-foot San Gorgonio Mountain, the highest mountain in southern California. From the flat desert lowlands, the mountains thrust upward in stark relief, creating indelible beauty along with a unique diversity of resources and a rich history of human habitation and movement. Along this remarkable topographic gradient lies an unusually wide range of ecosystems, ranging from lowland Mojave and Colorado deserts to scrub and woodlands and Mediterranean chaparral to subalpine and alpine conifer forests. San Gorgonio Mountain is one end of the longest recorded line of sight in the lower 48 States, the other being Mount Whitney, 190 miles away. In addition, the Henry Washington Survey Marker, located on San Bernardino Peak, serves as the starting point for surveying land in southern California and is included on the National Register of Historic Places.</FP>
  <FP>San Gorgonio, so named after Saint Gorgonius by early 17th century Spanish missionaries, is just one name for this remarkable, region-defining mountain. The Cahuilla Indians call the mountain Kwiria-Kaich, which means “bald” or “smooth,” and consider it among the sacred peaks of southern California. The Gabrielino Indians from the Los Angeles Basin treat San Gorgonio Mountain with reverence and refer to it as Akvangna. The Luiseño Indians consider San Gorgonio Mountain sacred and the older brother of Mount San Jacinto; both peaks were among the first born of Earth Mother. The Luiseño refer to San Gorgonio Mountain as Pewipwi.</FP>

  <FP>Thirty miles of the world famous Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail run through the Sand to Snow area, climbing 7,000 feet from the desert of Whitewater Canyon to Mission Springs in the San Bernardino National Forest. The history of this renowned trail dates back to the 1920s when the <PRTPAGE P="31"/>idea of a border-to-border trail was first conceptualized. Although the establishment of the trail took decades to fully materialize, today the trail is a national icon, highlighting the wilderness treasures of the American West. Since its completion, over 3,000 people have hiked the 2,600 miles of continuous trail along the Pacific crest, including the Mission Creek Canyon segment found within the Sand to Snow area.</FP>
  <FP>The Sand to Snow area first took its current shape 175 million years ago with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate. The San Bernardino Mountain range in the western half of the Sand to Snow area is unusual in California, a transverse range as distinct from the north-south mountain ranges found through most of California. This difference in direction results from a change in the San Andreas Fault, which shifts direction to the west of the Sand to Snow area. This intersection of mountains makes this area a critical bridge for wildlife traversing the high elevations of southern California's desert landscape.</FP>
  <FP>Two branches of the San Andreas Fault run through the Sand to Snow area, and the faulting that created the mountains and canyons throughout this landscape also created the Morongo Valley. The Whitewater Canyon area has been featured in numerous studies of the plate tectonics and geologic rifting of southern California, including studies that examine the impact of earthquakes on fault stability. The San Bernardino Mountains and Big Morongo Canyon contain ancient rocks from the Proterozoic Eon, along with some of the oldest exposed rocks in California, nearly 2 billion years old. Granite, gneiss, and schist in these areas have been used by geologists to better understand the tectonic history of the region, and are a testament to the area's important geologic past.</FP>
  <FP>Covering a range of nearly 10,000 feet in elevation, the Sand to Snow area includes an extraordinarily diverse range of ecosystems from lowland deserts, fresh water marshes, and Mojave riparian forests, to creosote bush scrub ecosystems, and alpine peaks. Hundreds of springs rise to the surface at South Fork Meadows, the origin of the South Fork of the Santa Ana River. The Sand to Snow area has been important to biological and ecological research, as well as studies of climate and land use change, the impact of fires and invasive species management.</FP>
  <FP>The area has a remarkable species richness that makes it one of most biodiverse areas in southern California. The area is home to 12 federally listed threatened and endangered animal species. Species include the endangered peninsular bighorn sheep, San Bernardino Merriam's kangaroo rat, Arroyo toad, Mountain Yellow-legged frog, and unarmored threespine stickleback, as well as the threatened Santa Ana sucker, Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard, and desert tortoise.</FP>

  <FP>A tremendous diversity of other wildlife species also make their homes here. In the San Gorgonio Wilderness, black bears, mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, and bighorn sheep can all be found. Species such as ringtails, kit fox, striped skunk, California ground squirrel, blacktail jackrabbit, and 19 species of bat live in the Big Morongo Canyon Preserve. Amphibians and reptiles including the Mohave Rattlesnake, red diamond rattlesnake, rosy boa, desert spiny lizard, California kingsnake, Western whiptail, and Pacific tree frog also live in the Sand to Snow area.<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The Sand to Snow area is famous for its oases frequented by over 240 species of birds, including the endangered Least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, and Yuma clapper rail, as well as the threatened coastal California gnatcatcher. Big Morongo Canyon, characterized by steep canyons, rugged terrain, and desert oases, is particularly high in biodiversity and is among the largest desert riparian habitats in California. It has been recognized as among the most important avian habitats in the State. Common birds found at Big Morongo Canyon include shore birds like the American white pelican, great blue heron, and green heron, raptors such as the Swainson's hawk, Northern Harrier, and American kestrel, owls, including the western screech-owl and great horned owl, and hummingbirds, woodpeckers, vireos, and finches. Additionally, 32 species of migratory birds of conservation concern have been identified in the Sand to Snow area, including eagles, sparrows, owls, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, and falcons, among others.</FP>
  <FP>The Sand to Snow area is home to dozens of native plant species, including 14 federally listed threatened or endangered species of flowering plants. These include the endangered California dandelion, Coachella Valley milk-vetch, Cushenbury buckwheat, Cushenbury oxytheca, pedate checker-mallow, San Bernardino bluegrass, San Bernardino Mountains bladderpod, Santa Ana River woolly-star, slender-petaled mustard, and triple-ribbed milk-vetch and the threatened ash-grey paintbrush, Bear Valley sandwort, Parish's daisy, and Southern Mountain wild-buckwheat. The southern-most stand of quaking aspen trees is located here as are important stands of white fir and bigcone Douglas-fir.</FP>
  <FP>The human history of the Sand to Snow area extends back thousands of years. People now identified as part of the Takic subset of the large Uto-Aztecan group of Native Americans arrived in the region around 2,500 years ago. Ancient people of the area used a wide variety of plants from both the mountains and the Mojave desert, such as honey mesquite, oak, piñon, cactus fruits, yucca roots, and tubers as well as grasses, seeds, and berries. Common tools were made of wood, bone, shell, stone, clay, and plant fibers. These people also manufactured woven goods, pipes made of stone, awls made of bone, tools associated with archery, and fire drills. They made coiled basketry and simple undecorated ceramic pots used for storage and transport.</FP>

  <FP>The name “Serrano” was given to people living in the Sand to Snow area by the Spanish missionaries in the late 18th century and translates from Spanish as a “person from the mountains.” In 1834, the Spanish forcibly relocated many Serrano people to the missions. In 1840 the Serrano suffered a devastating smallpox outbreak, and the disease returned in 1860. Ruth Benedict, one of the world's foremost cultural anthropologists, studied the Serrano extensively in 1924. However, by this time there were few remaining eastern groups and no old shamans or priests survived. Today, the rich archaeological resources in this area serve to preserve the history of the Serrano people. Black Lava Butte, topped by distinctive basaltic lava flows, is sacred to the Serrano Tribe and home to a substantial number of archaeological sites, including evidence of habitation, rock art, and possible ritual activities. Black Lava Butte contains an estimated 1,700 distinct petroglyphs, most of which have not yet been studied and may provide insight into the history of the Serrano and other tribes in the region. The <PRTPAGE P="33"/>mesa also contains dozens of isolated grinding and milling sites and at least one shelter site, where many milling stones are present.</FP>
  <FP>After the Holcomb Valley gold rush of 1860, ranchers used the area for grazing sheep, horses, and cattle. Many of the ranchers kept their herds at lower elevations during the winter and drove their stock to the meadows of the San Bernardino Mountains to graze during the summer months. Old cattle paths, watering holes, and campsites remain a part of the landscape today. Although not particularly successful, many miners prospected in the southeastern portions of the San Bernardino Mountains. Evidence still remains in the form of old cabins, mine shafts, prospecting pits, and refuse deposits.</FP>
  <FP>The protection of the Sand to Snow area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the historic and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. In addition to its significant scientific and historic values, the area also provides world class outdoor recreation opportunities, including hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, mountain biking, and horseback riding.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to modify and continue the national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996, and expanded by Proclamation 7757 of February 26, 2004, in light of the need to continue the national emergency based on a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States related to Cuba, and,</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the descriptions of the national emergency set forth in Proclamations 6867 and 7757 no longer reflect the international relations of the United States related to Cuba;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba had, at times, tended to isolate the United States from regional and international partners, constrained our ability to influence outcomes throughout the Western Hemisphere, and impaired the use of the full range of tools available to the United States to promote positive change in Cuba;</FP>

  <FP>WHEREAS the following descriptions accurately describe the national emergency with respect to Cuba;<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the United States and Cuba reestablished diplomatic relations and opened embassies in each other's capitals on July 20, 2015, and the United States continues to pursue the progressive normalization of relations while aspiring towards a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Cuba;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the United States has committed to work with the Government of Cuba on matters of mutual concern that advance U.S. national interests, such as migration, human rights, counter-narcotics, environmental protection, and trafficking in persons, among other issues;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the United States is committed to supporting safe, orderly, and legal migration from Cuba through the effective implementation of the 1994-95 U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the Cuban economy is in a relatively weak state, contributing to an outflow of its nationals towards the United States and neighboring countries;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the overarching objective of U.S. policy is stability in the region, and the outflow of Cuban nationals may have a destabilizing effect on the United States and its neighboring countries;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS it is United States policy that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security of the United States by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the United States continues to maintain an embargo with respect to Cuba;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy;</FP>

  </FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized transactions, and thereby threaten a disturbance of international relations.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">American Red Cross Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Over a century and a half ago, as gunfire echoed through America's skies and division flared between North and South, a trailblazing woman, Clara Barton, braved bullets and cannon fire to deliver much-needed care, comfort, and supplies to wounded soldiers of the Civil War. Undaunted by expectations of women at the time, Clara Barton persevered, as she had her whole life, and strived to aid those who sacrificed to save our Union. Determined that humanitarianism could thrive in peace as well as in conflict, she carried her resolve overseas upon the war's end and was introduced to a relief organization in Europe that inspired her to come home to the United States and establish the American Red Cross.</FP>
  <FP>Today, supporters, volunteers, and employees of the American Red Cross reflect the best of our Nation's spirit—responding to tens of thousands of tragedies here at home each year and bringing relief and assistance to suffering individuals across the globe. In the last year, countless people from the American Red Cross and many other service organizations have served on the front lines of disaster and done the hard work of improving our country and our world, never asking for credit or glory, fame or fortune. From floods that ravaged the plains of the Midwest and the coastlines of South Carolina, to wildfires that scorched California, and an earthquake that devastated Nepal, the American Red Cross has distributed almost one million relief items and provided tens of millions of dollars in assistance to victims. And when an influx of migrants from Syria stretched the capacities of countries around the world, the American Red Cross deployed tens of thousands of volunteers across the Atlantic to provide medical care and essential resources. These selfless heroes inspire hope and offer help to those in need, and as stalwarts in our communities, they build individual resilience and safeguard our blood supply.</FP>
  <FP>The spirit of resilience and service that drives our people in the wake of tragedy is what makes us an anchor of global strength and stability. When hardship strikes, countries around the world look to our Nation for help, and the American Red Cross and similar organizations demonstrate what is possible when compassionate people come together to uphold the basic values that define America—that we are each other's keepers and that we all must accept our obligations to one another. This month, let us be guided by the truth that we all share a similar destiny, and let us support organizations that work to lift up the lives of our planet's most vulnerable people. Together, we can give everyone a place to turn in times of crisis and uncertainty.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2016 as American Red Cross Month.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Irish-American Heritage Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Hailing from the Emerald Isle, generations of Irishmen and women have helped shape the idea of America, overcoming hardship and strife through strength and sacrifice, faith and family. With an undying belief that tomorrow always yields a brighter day, Irish Americans symbolize the perpetual optimism that defines our country, and they have long embodied the truth at the heart of our promise—that no matter who you are or where you come from, in America, you can make it if you try.</FP>
  <FP>As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month, we recognize the Irish people's contributions to our country's dynamism, and we reaffirm the friendship and family ties between our two nations. For centuries, sons and daughters of Erin have come to America's shores, adding to our rich vibrancy and putting their full hearts into everything they do. From building our country's cities as preeminent architects and earnest laborers to building our national character as people of great joy and cherished culture, Irish Americans have endured intolerance and discrimination to find a place for themselves and their children here in the United States. While remembering the great Irish Americans of the past, we celebrate what forms the foundation of the lasting Irish-American story—a shared embrace of hard work and humility, fairness and dignity, and a mutual quest to secure a freer and more peaceful future.</FP>
  <FP>Today, the United States and Ireland enjoy a thriving and cooperative bond buoyed by a strong legacy of exchanges between our peoples. During Irish-American Heritage Month, let us pay tribute to the extraordinary mark Irish Americans have made on our Nation, and let us look forward to continued collaboration, friendship, and partnership between our countries.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2016 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every year, more than 130,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and it kills nearly 50,000—making it the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Colorectal cancer touches too many, and together, we must work to lift up those who have been affected by it and all who remain vulnerable to it. This month, as we remember the loved ones we have lost and lift up those who continue to fight colorectal cancer, we strive to save lives by raising awareness of this disease and encouraging everyone to take measures to prevent it.</FP>
  <FP>Although age, obesity, and certain genetic mutations can increase risk of colorectal cancer, all Americans should be aware of its risk factors, which include being physically inactive, having an unhealthy diet, smoking cigarettes, and consuming alcohol in excess. People who have had inflammatory bowel disease or who have a family history of colorectal cancer may also be at particularly high risk. While people of all ages should consult a physician about their susceptibility, individuals between ages 50 and 75 are encouraged to get regular screenings. Symptoms such as blood in stool, persistent stomach pains, and inexplicable weight loss can be present, but sometimes no symptoms occur, which is why early detection and treatment are key for battling colorectal cancer. I urge all people to visit www.Cancer.gov for more information, including early warning signs and tips for prevention.</FP>
  <FP>I am committed to combating all forms of cancer—including colorectal cancer—and to reaching a future when no family knows the pain cancer causes. Earlier this year, I announced a new initiative led by Vice President Joe Biden: a national effort to put the United States on a path to becoming the country that finally cures cancer once and for all—aiming within 5 years to make critical advances that may have otherwise taken more than a decade to achieve. And we have already proposed a $1 billion initiative to kick off this critical work. The Affordable Care Act now requires health care plans to cover certain recommended preventive services, including many screening tests for cancer, at no additional cost—an important provision that helps ensure more people can access critical tests. It also prohibits insurance companies from charging more for pre-existing conditions, including cancer. While work remains to be done to confront the challenges posed by colorectal cancer, we have made great progress in fighting it and informing people of its dangers.</FP>
  <FP>All people deserve to lead long, happy, and healthy lives, and nobody should be robbed of that promise due to the devastating impacts of colorectal cancer. During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, let us honor the legacy of those we have lost to this cancer by spreading awareness of it, uplifting all who live with it, and pledging our full talent, resources, and will to defeating it.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2016 as National <PRTPAGE P="43"/>Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's History Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Throughout history, women have driven humanity forward on the path to a more equal and just society, contributing in innumerable ways to our character and progress as a people. In the face of discrimination and undue hardship, they have never given up on the promise of America: that with hard work and determination, nothing is out of reach. During Women's History Month, we remember the trailblazers of the past, including the women who are not recorded in our history books, and we honor their legacies by carrying forward the valuable lessons learned from the powerful examples they set.</FP>
  <FP>For too long, women were formally excluded from full participation in our society and our democracy. Because of the courage of so many bold women who dared to transcend preconceived expectations and prove they were capable of doing all that a man could do and more, advances were made, discoveries were revealed, barriers were broken, and progress triumphed. Whether serving in elected positions across America, leading groundbreaking civil rights movements, venturing into unknown frontiers, or programming revolutionary technologies, generations of women that knew their gender was no obstacle to what they could accomplish have long stirred new ideas and opened new doors, having a profound and positive impact on our Nation. Through hardship and strife and in every realm of life, women have spurred change in communities around the world, steadfastly joining together to overcome adversity and lead the charge for a fairer, more inclusive, and more progressive society.</FP>

  <FP>During Women's History Month, we honor the countless women who sacrificed and strived to ensure all people have an equal shot at pursuing the American dream. As President, the first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for working American women to effectively challenge illegal, unequal pay disparities. Additionally, my Administration proposed collecting pay data from businesses to shine a light on pay discrimination, and I signed an Executive Order to ensure the Federal Government only works with and awards contracts to businesses that follow laws that uphold fair and equal labor practices. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer charge women more <PRTPAGE P="44"/>for health insurance simply because of their gender. And last year, we officially opened for women the last jobs left unavailable to them in our military, because one of the best ways to ensure our Armed Forces remains the strongest in the world is to draw on the talents and skills of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>Though we have made great progress toward achieving gender equality, work remains to be done. Women still earn, on average, less for every dollar made by men, which is why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act—a sensible step to provide women with basic tools to fight pay discrimination. Meanwhile, my Administration has taken steps to support working families by fighting for paid leave for all Americans, providing women with more small business loans and opportunities, and addressing the challenges still faced by women and girls of color, who consistently face wider opportunity gaps and structural barriers—including greater discrepancies in pay. And although the majority of our Nation's college and graduate students are women, they are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which is why we are encouraging more women and girls to pursue careers in these fields.</FP>
  <FP>This May, the White House will host a summit on “The United State of Women,” to highlight the advances we have made in the United States and across the globe and to expand our efforts on helping women confront the challenges they face and reach for their highest aspirations. We must strive to build the future we want our children to inherit—one in which their dreams are not deferred or denied, but where they are uplifted and praised. We have come far, but there is still far to go in shattering the glass ceiling that holds women back. This month, as we reflect on the marks made by women throughout history, let us uphold the responsibility that falls on all of us—regardless of gender—and fight for equal opportunity for our daughters as well as our sons.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2016 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2016, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also invite all Americans to visit www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the generations of women who have left enduring imprints on our history.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Read Across America Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>From a child's first foray into the depths of a story to an adult's escape into a world of words, reading plays an integral role in our lives. Works of fiction and non-fiction alike pique interest and inspiration and shape our understanding of each other and ourselves, teaching us lessons in kindness and humility, responsibility and respect. The moment we persuade a child to pick up a book for the first time we change their lives forever for the better, and on Read Across America Day, we recommit to getting literary works into our young peoples' hands early and often.</FP>
  <FP>March 2 is also the birthday of one of America's revered wordsmiths. Theodor Seuss Geisel—or Dr. Seuss—used his incredible talent to instill in his most impressionable readers universal values we all hold dear. Through a prolific collection of stories, he made children see that reading is fun, and in the process, he emphasized respect for all; pushed us to accept ourselves for who we are; challenged preconceived notions and encouraged trying new things; and by example, taught us that we are limited by nothing but the range of our aspirations and the vibrancy of our imaginations. And for older lovers of literature, he reminded us not to take ourselves too seriously, creating wacky and wild characters and envisioning creative and colorful places.</FP>
  <FP>Books reveal unexplored universes and stimulate curiosity, and in underserved communities, they play a particularly important role in prompting inquisition and encouraging ambition. Last month, the First Lady announced the launch of Open eBooks, a new project that will unlock a world of learning and possibility for millions of American children and provide over $250 million worth of reading material to students who need it most. As we work to get every child engrossed in literature, we honor the many people who devote their lives and careers to carrying forward this important cause—including our librarians, educators, and parents. We can all get lost in a good read, and we owe it to rising learners to give them the chance to experience that same enjoyment and fulfillment.</FP>
  <FP>Today, and every day, let us celebrate the power of reading by promoting literacy and supporting new opportunities for students to plunge into the pages of a book. As Dr. Seuss noted, “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” Together, we can help all children go plenty of places along their unending journey for knowledge and ensure everyone can find joy and satisfaction in the wonders of the written word.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2016, as Read Across America Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Consumer Protection Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>After a long road to recovery, our Nation has risen from the depths of recession thanks to the grit and determination of the American people. Ensuring hardworking families feel secure and confident that they can get ahead without being ripped off or getting sucked into vicious cycles of debt was essential to our rebound and is critical to our continuing efforts to build an economy that works better for everyone. When we uphold our country's promise of fairness and opportunity, we all do better, and during National Consumer Protection Week, we reaffirm our fidelity to this ideal by striving to build an economy based on the principles of fair play, equal access, and shared responsibility.</FP>
  <FP>When I took office, big banks that made reckless bets were relying on the American people to clean up after them. That is why my Administration pursued historic Wall Street reform, enacting strong consumer protections and stabilizing the foundation of our country's economic prosperity. We proposed new rules that protect people from unscrupulous lenders—including those engaged in abusive practices involving payday loans and title loans, which too often trap families in unfair and expensive cycles of fees. Additionally, because no one should be saddled with debt before they get started in life, we capped student loan payments at 10 percent of a borrower's monthly income through the Pay As You Earn plan. We also established a Student Aid Bill of Rights that calls for all students to have access to a quality, affordable education and the resources to pay for it, as well as the right to affordable loan payments, quality customer service, reliable information, and equal treatment. And to ensure the American dream can be enjoyed by those who selflessly defend it, we announced updated rules to close loopholes that allowed predatory lenders to demand unfair payments and exorbitant fees from our men and women in uniform and their families.</FP>

  <FP>While Government plays an important role in protecting our people and our financial system, individuals can take steps on their own to detect abuse and safeguard their assets and personal data. As we continue to educate the public on matters of personal finance and inform young people of the dangers of too much debt, consumers should thoroughly read and understand their loan agreements, assess their own financial capacity, and <PRTPAGE P="47"/>take care to guard against identity theft. To assist in this effort, my Administration will keep working to make online transactions more secure, convenient, and private. For additional information on your rights as a consumer, visit www.NCPW.gov, and to report and recover from identity theft, visit www.IdentityTheft.gov.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout this week, let us celebrate the core values of honesty and fair play by upholding the basic American bargain—that hard work should pay off and responsibility should be rewarded. Together, we can ensure nobody is financially taken advantage of and everybody has an equal opportunity to go as far as their dreams and talents will take them.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 6 through March 12, 2016, as National Consumer Protection Week.

  <FP>2. Sections 506A(d)(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(d)(4)(C)) and 506A(c)(1) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(c)(1)) of the 1974 Act authorize the President to suspend the application of duty-free treatment provided for any article described in section 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(b)(1)) or 19 U.S.C. 3721 with respect to a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if he determines that the beneficiary country is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending such duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting compliance by the country with those requirements than terminating the designation of the country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act.</FP>
  <FP>3. In Proclamation 9388 of January 11, 2016, pursuant to section 506A(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, I determined that South Africa was not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending the application of duty-free treatment to certain goods would be more effective in promoting compliance by South Africa with such requirements than terminating the designation of South Africa as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. Thus, pursuant to section 506A(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, I suspended the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector from South Africa for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016.</FP>
  <FP>4. Pursuant to section 506A of the 1974 Act, based on actions that the Government of South Africa has taken to come into compliance with the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that suspending the application of duty-free treatment to certain goods is no longer necessary to promote compliance by South Africa with such requirements.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Poison Prevention Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>As the leading cause of accidental injury death in the United States, poisonings can harm people of all ages and from all walks of life. More than 90 percent of poisonings occur inside the home, and most are treatable and preventable. During National Poison Prevention Week, we work to ensure the safety of our homes and communities by learning of the dangers of poison and striving to prevent poisonings.</FP>
  <FP>The most common sources of poisoning in young children are items typically found at home, including cleaning, cosmetic, and personal care products, as well as over-the-counter and prescription medications. Although children are more likely to be poisoned, adults—who are most commonly poisoned by cleaning products, or by the improper use of sedatives, antidepressants, pain relievers, or prescription drugs—are far more likely to die from poison exposure.</FP>
  <FP>With diligence and caution, these tragedies can be avoided. Make sure household products are kept in their original bottles and away from children, and never mix such products together. Some poisonous materials and vapors are harder to identify, including carbon monoxide—a colorless and odorless, yet very dangerous, gas. Everyone should have carbon monoxide detectors in their home, use them properly, and get them tested regularly. Medications should always be kept out of the reach of children, and whether prescription or over-the-counter, all drugs should be taken safely and in accordance with guidance on the label or as prescribed and instructed by healthcare professionals. To learn more about keeping you and your family safe from poison, visit www.PoisonHelp.HRSA.gov, and for more information on how to safely dispose of drugs, including by participating in the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day on April 30, visit www.DEAdiversion.USDOJ.gov.</FP>
  <FP>We can all play a role in preventing poisoning tragedies from occurring. Every individual can take steps on their own to make their homes safer and to learn of appropriate actions to take in the event of a poisoning incident. If you believe someone has been poisoned, immediately call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. By coming together to secure potentially-toxic materials in our homes and communities and by educating our friends and family on methods of prevention, we can help ensure no person is deprived of a full and healthy life due to poisoning.</FP>

  <FP>To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, the Congress, by <PRTPAGE P="50"/>joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681) has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as “National Poison Prevention Week.”</FP>

  <FP>Inspired by ancient Greece's example, America's Founding Fathers drew on Hellenic principles to guide our democracy in its nascence. Nearly half a century after the Stars and Stripes first flew over our country, a flag was raised on a mountaintop in Greece, and a revolution spawned that would bring democracy back to its birthplace and lay the cornerstone of the close relationship enjoyed by our two nations. On the 195th anniversary of Greece's independence, we celebrate the friendship between our countries and honor the contributions that Greek Americans have made to our national character.</FP>
  <FP>Our common histories are reflected in our shared values. Throughout our storied pasts, our peoples have upheld the fundamental ideals we cherish by working together to safeguard the foundation of democracy upon which both our nations are built. Greeks and Americans have long stood shoulder-to-shoulder in defense of freedom, and today, the Greek American community carries forward the legacy of past Greeks who enlightened our world by continuing to enrich our society in unique ways. Driving generations, the hope that incited both our revolutions still burns in the hearts of Greek Americans and in all those across our country who seek even greater opportunity for our children and grandchildren.</FP>
  <FP>The Greek people have faced extraordinary challenges in recent years, yet they remain steadfast in their resilience and perseverance. In response to an ongoing refugee and migration crisis, Greece is providing humanitarian assistance to countless men, women, and children seeking freedom from persecution and violence. As Americans, we stand with Greece as partners, friends, and NATO allies, and the Greek American community serves as an important bridge that helps bring us together. At our core, we share deep ties of culture and family, and respect for the fundamental rights of democratic States. Through good times and bad, we share a common commitment to security and liberty for people around the world.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">César Chávez Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>As a child of migrant workers who struggled just to get by, César Chávez knew the importance of having an economy that works for everyone and devoted his life to ensuring our Nation upheld the values upon which it was founded. On his birthday, we celebrate a man who reminded us—above all else—that we all share a common humanity, each of us having our own value and contributing to the same destiny, and we carry forward his legacy by echoing his peaceful and eloquent calls for a more just and equal society.</FP>
  <FP>César Chávez demonstrated that true courage is revealed when the outlook is darkest, the resistance is strongest, and we still find it within ourselves to stand up for what we believe in. In the face of extraordinary adversity and opposition, he stood up for the inherent dignity of every person, no matter their race, color, creed, or sexual orientation, and for the idea that when workers are treated fairly, we give meaning to our founding ideals. Guided by his faith in his convictions, he fasted, marched, and rallied millions to “La Causa” to expand opportunity and demand a voice for workers everywhere. Together with Dolores Huerta, he founded the United Farm Workers, and through boycotts and protests, he ushered in a new era of respect for America's laborers and farm workers.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we honor César Chávez by continuing to fight for what he believed in, including a living wage for workers and their right to unionize and provide for their family. Workers should have a safe workplace and the comfort of knowing that if they work hard, they can feed their family, earn decent benefits, and gain the skills they need to move up and get ahead. We will also keep up our efforts to reform our Nation's broken immigration system so more people can contribute to our country's success. And as we strive for well-deserved policies for America's workers, like a higher minimum wage and paid leave, we are reminded that the movement César Chávez led was sustained by a generation of organizers who spoke out and fought for a better, fairer America—and it is now upon us to do the same in our time.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's progress has always been driven by the belief that extraordinary things happen when we come together around a common cause, and through decades of organizing and serving others, César Chávez embodied this ideal. On César Chávez Day, let us unite to reach for the America he knew was possible—one in which hard work is rewarded, prosperity is shared, and equal opportunity is the right of all our people.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2016, as César Chávez Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community, and education programs to honor César Chávez's enduring legacy.<PRTPAGE P="53"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Cancer Control Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Undaunted by challenge and unceasing in pursuit of progress, our Nation has pushed the boundaries of possibility throughout our history. Today, while cancer remains among the leading causes of death around the world and the second leading cause of death here at home, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs, offering incredible promise to those suffering from this disease. This month, we remember the loved ones we have lost, pledge support for the families we can still save, and reaffirm our commitment to curing cancer once and for all.</FP>
  <FP>Cancer can affect people of all ages, races, and backgrounds, but certain risk factors exist that can often be mitigated. Limiting alcohol consumption, controlling sun exposure, exercising, getting recommended cancer screenings, and maintaining a healthy diet are all ways to reduce your risk of getting cancer. Additionally, smoking remains one of the top causes of cancer, responsible for 1 in 3 cancer deaths in the United States. By promoting resources to help people quit smoking and limiting exposure to secondhand smoke, we can reduce individuals' cancer risks. Help for quitting smoking can be found at www.SmokeFree.gov or by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW. I urge all Americans to visit www.Cancer.gov or www.CDC.gov/Cancer to learn more.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to reaching a future free from cancer in all its forms. Earlier this year, I created the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. Chaired by Vice President Joe Biden, this effort aims to accelerate our progress toward prevention, treatment, and cures by putting ourselves on a path to achieving at least a decade's worth of advances in 5 years. Together with patients, philanthropies, private industry, and the medical and scientific communities, the United States can be the country that finally finds a cure for this disease, and we have already proposed a $1 billion initiative to jumpstart this critical work. The Affordable Care Act continues to help people with cancer and at risk for cancer by prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to anyone based on a preexisting condition and requiring insurers to cover recommended preventive benefits without cost-sharing. And the Precision Medicine Initiative that I launched last year continues to work toward a new era of medicine that offers targeted treatment at the right time to individual patients by accounting for their unique genes, health histories, and other personal factors.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation has made extraordinary strides in the fight against cancer, but much work remains to be done. With more than one and a half million new cases of cancer expected in the United States this year, we owe it to <PRTPAGE P="54"/>everyone currently living with it and to anyone at risk to support all those working to defeat it. During National Cancer Control Month, let us remember those who lost their battle with cancer, and let us renew our efforts to save lives and spare heartbreak by reaching a future without this devastating disease.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as “Cancer Control Month.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Cancer Control Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>All children deserve to grow up in a caring and loving environment, yet across America, hundreds of thousands of children are neglected or abused each year, often causing lasting consequences. Although effectively intervening in the lives of these children and their families is an important responsibility at all levels of government, preventing abuse and neglect is a shared obligation. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we recommit to giving every child a chance to succeed and to ensuring that every child grows up in a safe, stable, and nurturing environment that is free from abuse and neglect.</FP>
  <FP>Preventing child abuse is an effort that we must undertake as one American family, and in our schools, neighborhoods, and communities, we must look after every child as if they are our own. Between four and eight children die every day from abuse or neglect, but together we can prevent these tragedies from occurring. Children who are being abused or neglected may display constant alertness, sudden changes in behavior and school performance, or untreated physical or medical issues. Child abuse may take many forms, including neglect and physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. More information on preventing child abuse can be found at www.ChildWelfare.gov/Preventing.</FP>

  <FP>All families can benefit from strong support systems and resources in the face of these challenges, and as parents, friends, neighbors, and fellow human beings, keeping our kids safe is among our highest priorities. My Administration is dedicated to fostering healthy and supportive conditions <PRTPAGE P="55"/>that enable our children to develop and thrive and that ensure parents and caretakers have the resources they need to properly care for their children. We are supporting efforts that lift up vulnerable families, improve the coordination of programs and services within communities, and promote meaningful and measurable changes in the lives of children across America to improve their social and emotional well-being. The effects of child abuse and neglect can negatively impact a child throughout their life. Together, we must address this issue so that our children and our children's children never know the pain caused by child abuse.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's enduring commitment to prevent child abuse and neglect demands that individuals and communities partner together to provide safe and nurturing environments for all of America's daughters and sons. We must all join in the work of uplifting and safeguarding our youngest individuals and ensuring they are limited by nothing but the size of their dreams and the range of their aspirations. This month, let us aim to eradicate child abuse from our society, and let us secure a future for our children that is bright and full of hope, opportunity, and security.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and provide for children's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Financial Capability Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>When every American has the tools they need to get ahead and contribute to our country's success, we are all better off. Since the recession, we have built our economy to be better and stronger than before, but we still have work to do to make hardworking families' paychecks go further. Ensuring people have the resources to make informed decisions about their finances is critical in this effort, and during National Financial Capability Month, we recommit to equipping individuals with the knowledge and protections necessary to secure a stable financial future for themselves and their families.</FP>

  <FP>At some of life's most important junctures—including buying a home, pursuing an education, or saving for retirement—having access to reliable information about our country's financial system can help people avoid being ripped off or sucked into cycles of debt they cannot get out of. That is why my Administration is promoting tools to protect and empower individuals, <PRTPAGE P="56"/>working to increase borrowers' understanding of what they are getting into before they take out a loan, and educating more people on how to think about their money. I encourage all Americans to call 1-800-FED-INFO or visit www.MyMoney.gov and www.ConsumerFinance.gov for access to free and reliable financial information.</FP>

  <FP>No young person should be saddled with excessive debt. In addition to striving to inform young people of the dangers of taking out too much consumer debt, my Administration launched the “Know Before You Owe” campaign, which is helping America's college students know their full range of options for financing a higher education. I also created the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans to help educate our rising generation on important money management skills so they can live with security and make positive contributions to our economy. So more of our people can retire with dignity and stability, we established a new type of savings bond, <E T="03">my</E>RA, to help more Americans easily save for retirement. And I signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other consumer protections, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the first agency solely dedicated to protecting consumers from unfair practices and predatory products in financial services.</FP>
  <FP>As our economy continues to grow, we must preserve the basic notion in our country that hard work will be rewarded and that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can make it if you try. This month, let us encourage informed financial decisions and promote resources that help the American people make them, and let us reaffirm our belief in the idea that opportunity should be within reach for all who are willing to work for it.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with programs and activities to improve their understanding of financial principles and practices.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>At our country's core is a basic belief in the inherent dignity of every person. Too many women and men of all ages suffer the outrage that is sexual assault, and too often, this crime is not condemned as loudly as it should <PRTPAGE P="57"/>be. Together, we must stand up and speak out to change the culture that questions the actions of victims, rather than those of their attackers. As their relatives, friends, neighbors, and fellow Americans, it's on us to support victims and survivors by providing them with the care they need, bringing perpetrators to justice, and ensuring our institutions are held responsible and do not look the other way. This month, we reaffirm our commitment to shift the attitudes that allow sexual assault to go unanswered and unpunished, and we redouble our efforts to prevent this human rights violation from happening in the first place.</FP>
  <FP>Preventing sexual assault begins with everyone getting involved in promoting healthy relationships and encouraging respect for the equality of others. For decades, Vice President Joe Biden has brought unmatched passion to this cause, working to pass the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate more than two decades ago, and continuing to fight today to transform the way we think and talk about sexual assault. In 2014, we launched the “It's On Us” campaign—an initiative that has worked with over 300 college campuses and engaged hundreds of thousands of people around our country who have taken a pledge to stand up and speak out to express moral outrage for this intolerable crime. We launched the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault that year as well, which continues to offer recommendations for how we can all contribute to a society that adequately prevents and responds to sexual assault.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is taking action to eliminate sexual assault in every corner of our country. This year, we announced new grants available for the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, a nationwide, community-based effort to end the backlog of untested rape kits—instrumental tools used to collect evidence, prosecute perpetrators, and bring closure to victims in the aftermath of an assault. These funds are supporting efforts to ensure victims are notified of the testing, connected to support services, and given the option of participating in the criminal justice process. Additionally, we have offered new tools and resources to help States and communities take advantage of the best available measures to prevent sexual violence. The Department of Justice issued new guidance for law enforcement on identifying and preventing gender bias in response to sexual assault and domestic violence. And I have directed military leadership to prioritize this issue and equip our men and women in uniform with the knowledge and tools necessary to combat sexual violence. From our military to our schools, and in law enforcement agencies in communities across America, we will keep working to address sexual violence and root it out wherever it exists.</FP>
  <FP>Anyone can be a leader in the fight to prevent and end sexual assault. As employers, educators, parents, and friends, all Americans have an obligation to uphold the basic principle that every individual should be free from violence and fear. During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit to embracing each of our individual responsibilities to keep our communities safe from this crime and to stand with survivors and victims of sexual assault.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to <PRTPAGE P="58"/>support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these crimes in their communities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Donate Life Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>By becoming an organ donor, one person can save the lives of up to eight people and improve the lives of dozens—mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters—who are desperately in need of a transplant. During National Donate Life Month, we lift up the thousands of selfless individuals across America who are living or registered organ donors. And as we honor those who have saved lives in the past by donating organs, we recommit to supporting the researchers, innovators, advocates, and medical professionals working to reduce the number of people awaiting vital organ transplants.</FP>
  <FP>A rising demand for organs exists without enough organs to meet it, making the urgency for those willing and able to donate even more critical and the need for innovation and support even more imperative. My Administration has striven to support donors and recipients and to expand the availability of organs for transplant. In 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), building on efforts within the transplant community, launched a nationwide kidney exchange program to bring together pairs of kidney donors and recipients in an effort to increase the quality and quantity of kidney transplants. HHS has also made more financial support available to low-income living donors to help cover expenses like travel and lodging costs that are often incurred throughout the donation process. The Affordable Care Act offers greater security to living donors by prohibiting insurers from denying health coverage to someone with a preexisting condition—donating an organ may have previously been considered a preexisting condition and prevented individuals from obtaining the care they deserved after selflessly giving an organ to someone in need. And in 2013, I signed the bipartisan HOPE Act, paving the way for the first transplants in the United States between HIV-positive donors and recipients—and the first of these life-saving transplants took place earlier this year.</FP>
  <FP>Anyone can indicate their desire to be a donor, regardless of age or medical history, and I encourage all Americans to consult their family members and communicate their choice. More information on donation and opportunities to register can be found by visiting www.OrganDonor.gov.</FP>

  <FP>Through Medicare, the Federal Government spends nearly $35 billion each year to care for the more than half a million patients with end-stage kidney <PRTPAGE P="59"/>failure in the United States. Increasing accessibility to organs can save lives while helping to defray overall healthcare costs. As we work to get more people off of the waiting list and into the operating room for a transplant, we are continuing to invest in researching new and innovative ways to address this critical issue. Over the span of three recent years, we invested nearly $3 billion into regenerative medicine research, and we are making great strides in advancing treatment and improving technological capabilities. Additionally, we have opened new doors of collaboration with businesses, universities, and foundations to progress our prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases. Our Nation has taken bold steps in recent years, and we will continue working to reduce the organ waiting list by building on our efforts to utilize regeneration and other methods for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand of vital organs.</FP>
  <FP>Last year, the United States exceeded 30,000 annual organ transplants for the first time. Progress has been made and great promise exists, but much work remains to help the more than 120,000 Americans on the organ waiting list. This month, let us remember those we have lost and provide support to all who continue to wait and hope. Across government, industry, academia, private organizations, and the medical and philanthropic communities, we must all do our part to lift up donors, donor families, and patients by supporting efforts to shorten the organ waiting list. Together, we can improve and save lives by celebrating those who give of themselves—whether as living donors or as registered donors—to provide the greatest gift there is to offer.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to join forces to boost the number of organ, eye, and tissue donors throughout our Nation.</FP>

  <FP>During National Public Health Week, we join together to enhance public health—the foundation of our security and well-being—here at home and around the world. By supporting health professionals and embracing our obligations to promote public health and protect our planet, we can uphold our shared responsibility to preserve the promise of a happy and healthy life for our children and grandchildren.<PRTPAGE P="60"/>
  </FP>

  <FP>Ensuring all Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance is imperative for maintaining our public health, and I am proud that 6 years after I signed it, the Affordable Care Act has extended the peace of mind that comes with health coverage to 20 million Americans. First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative is encouraging more physical activity and nutritious food choices for our Nation's youth, engaging parents and kids in the work of building stronger, healthier communities. To spare more American families heartbreak, I have proposed over 1 billion dollars in new funding to address prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, a public health issue that has taken a devastating toll on too many. We are also striving to promote mental health as an essential component of overall health, helping ensure access to mental health care and services and working to prevent suicide. And because public safety is a critical component of addressing public health, I announced new, commonsense steps this year to help address our country's epidemic of gun violence and keep our neighborhoods safe.</FP>
  <FP>Just as we must sustain a healthy world today, we must do everything in our power to preserve it for those who will inherit it. Climate change has a profound impact on our public health, contributing to intensified smog, an extended allergy season, the spread of diseases into new regions, and greater and more acute incidence of asthma. Last year, the White House hosted a Summit on Climate Change and Health to expand awareness of the real threat a changing climate poses to our health and to focus on vulnerable groups who may face more serious challenges adapting to climate change. No community is immune to this reality, nor can any nation cordon itself off from climate or the air we share. That is why last year, along with nearly 200 countries from around the world, the United States negotiated the Paris Agreement—the most ambitious climate change agreement in history that commits all participating parties to putting forward climate targets of growing stringency to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Adopting this agreement for an international framework builds on domestic actions we have already taken to invest in clean energy, reduce our carbon emissions, and transition to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.</FP>
  <FP>Like the threat of climate change, other public health challenges—like infectious diseases—cannot be addressed by any one nation alone. In an increasingly interconnected world, we face new trials that demand international attention. My Administration is working with our international partners to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We also launched the Global Health Security Agenda, which aims to strengthen all countries' public health systems and stop the spread of disease outbreaks by ensuring nations from around the world have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats to our health and safety. Already, this cooperation is helping us confront the spread of the Zika virus.</FP>

  <FP>America is built on the notion that we are our brothers' and our sisters' keepers, and that we all have certain obligations to one another. Never is that idea truer than when ensuring the health of the world our children will live in long after we are gone. This week, let us treat every child as if they are our own by accepting our responsibilities to leave them with a healthier, cleaner planet than we have, and let us continue reaching for a brighter, more secure future for all the world's people.<PRTPAGE P="61"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World Autism Awareness Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every person deserves the chance to reach for their highest hopes and fulfill their greatest potential. On World Autism Awareness Day, we reaffirm our dedication to ensuring that belief is a reality for all those who live on the autism spectrum—including 1 in 68 children. And we uphold our obligation to help make sure every man, woman, and child, regardless of ability or background, is accepted for who they are and able to lead a life free from discrimination and filled with opportunity.</FP>
  <FP>From home to school and in businesses and communities around the world, people living with autism spectrum disorder contribute in immeasurable ways to our society. They remind us each day that every person is born with unique talents and should be treated with respect, play an active role in planning for their futures, and feel empowered to fully participate in and contribute to their communities. When those with autism have access to equal opportunities, we all do better, and that begins with making sure our country lives up to its commitment to ensure all things are possible for all people.</FP>

  <FP>Individuals with autism are just as deserving of the peace of mind that comes with having quality, affordable health insurance as anyone else. The Affordable Care Act helps ensure no person is prevented from obtaining health coverage simply because they live with a preexisting condition like autism, and it requires most plans to cover recommended preventive services—including critical screenings that test for autism in children. My Administration is dedicated to ensuring educational opportunities for autistic students are worthy of their extraordinary potential and to providing Americans with autism the chance to earn good jobs and hone their skills and talents. We are working to break down barriers to competitive, integrated employment for people with disabilities, including people with autism. We are also promoting inclusivity for kids with autism in high-quality, early childhood education programs. In 2014, I signed the Autism CARES Act, which supports autism-related research and helps us to better understand the particular challenges faced by students and young adults living on the autism spectrum. And this month marks 3 years since my Administration <PRTPAGE P="62"/>launched the BRAIN Initiative—a collaborative effort by Federal agencies, philanthropies, universities, foundations, and others in the medical and scientific communities that aims to accelerate our work to solve some of the most intricate mysteries of human brain function and reveal new insights into conditions like autism. In my most recent budget proposal, I was proud to support increased funding for this important initiative.</FP>
  <FP>Americans with autism play an important role in our national story, and in their daily lives they embody the belief at the heart of our founding: that in America, with hard work and equal access, all people can realize their aspirations. Today, and every day, let us reach for a future in which no person living on the autism spectrum is limited by anything but the size of their dreams—one in which all people have the opportunity to live a life filled with a sense of identity, purpose, and self-determination.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2016, as World Autism Awareness Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In the aftermath of a crime, it is imperative that victims have access to the resources they need to recover and to ensure that justice is done. During the 35th National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we stand with victims and their families, and we strive to ensure every person—regardless of age, color, or creed—who is victimized by crime knows they are protected, respected, and heard.</FP>

  <FP>Certain populations are more vulnerable to crime, and my Administration is committed to defending the rights of crime victims everywhere and safeguarding their access to essential resources and services. Violence against women, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, is too prevalent in our society, and we will continue doing everything we can to shine a light on these crimes wherever they exist, including on our campuses and in our military. We are taking action to reduce the number of untested rape kits in America—critical tools that can deliver justice for victims in the wake of an assault—and the Department of Justice issued new guidance to prevent gender bias when responding to cases of sexual assault and domestic violence. Additionally, the <E T="03">My Brother's Keeper</E> initiative is working to reduce violence and secure second chances for <PRTPAGE P="63"/>our youth to ensure all young people—including those from communities disproportionately affected by violent crime—have the opportunities and resources they need to reach their full potential.</FP>
  <FP>A victim's immediate interactions after a crime are often with the law enforcement officials who are the first to respond. In 2014, I created the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing (Task Force), and in addition to promoting ways to enhance public safety across America, the Task Force issued recommendations to strengthen public trust between local law enforcement and communities, which increases the likelihood that victims and witnesses will cooperate with law enforcement after a crime. My Administration will also continue working to support the most vulnerable among us who are subject to heinous crimes—including children who are forced into sex trafficking and denied their inherent human rights, and seniors who, in too many cases, are exposed to abuse, neglect, and exploitation.</FP>
  <FP>When a crime does occur, we owe it to those who suffer in its aftermath to uplift them and stand beside them. This week, as we honor those dedicated to ensuring services and support are available for victims of crime, let us rededicate ourselves to protecting crime victims' rights and upholding the basic belief that all people should be able to live safely and free from fear, violence, and intimidation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 16, 2016, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week.

In underserved neighborhoods, they help cultivate hope and inspiration, rolling back poverty and roadblocks to opportunity. Generations of these often unsung heroes—driven by their conviction that we all have a stake in each other—have lifted up those they know and those they do not, making our Nation and our world a better place.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to giving people more opportunities to serve. I established a Task Force on Expanding National Service that supports the expansion of service and volunteer projects to address some of our Nation's highest priorities. Through the Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have mobilized millions of Americans, sending them to areas in need of dedicated volunteers. Under these programs, we have established campaigns that address specific needs in vulnerable communities, such as increasing access to college, improving STEM education, and preserving our environment. I have also called on 200,000 Federal scientists and engineers to help mentor young people in STEM fields. And in 2014, I launched the Employers of National Service initiative, connecting employers with AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni—because often the most talented, tireless, and mission-driven employees are those who have given of themselves for the betterment of others. In the time since, hundreds of employers have signed up to participate in this program.</FP>
  <FP>Volunteers help drive our country's progress, and day in and day out, they make extraordinary sacrifices to expand promise and possibility. During National Volunteer Week, let us shed the cynicism that says one person cannot make a difference in the lives of others by embracing each of our individual responsibilities to serve and shape a brighter future for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 16, 2016, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

  <EAR>Proc. 9420</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>A decade before the turn of the 19th century, representatives of countries from across the Western Hemisphere formed what would become the Organization of American States, striving to ensure peace and democracy through unity and cooperation among our nations. As we mark 126 years since its founding, we also celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter—a declaration of our belief in democracy as the common form of government for all countries in our hemisphere. On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we reflect on the progress our countries have made together, and we recommit to reaching for a brighter day for all our peoples.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout our hemisphere, increased integration has generated greater growth and prosperity. Since I took office, exports and imports between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere have increased by more than 50 percent. We are involved in more trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty, spur opportunity, and empower young people with the skills and job training they need to compete in the global economy. Our nations have partnered to develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources and ensure all countries have open access to data to combat climate change—a reality that threatens all our peoples and that we addressed in Paris late last year, when the world came together to negotiate the most ambitious climate agreement in history.</FP>
  <FP>The nations of the Americas have made tremendous progress on important issues, and our work remains rooted in the bonds of friendship and family between our peoples. For too long, the United States and Cuba remained isolated, and while our governments will continue to have areas of disagreement, our people have long shared common values and ideals. That is why we reestablished diplomatic relations between our countries—for the first time in over 50 years, the American flag flies above our reopened embassy in Havana; and I recently visited our neighbor 90 miles to the South, becoming the first United States President to do so in nearly nine decades. By extending a new hand of friendship to the Cuban people, we mark the beginning of a relationship that will offer fresh hope for both our futures and improve the lives of those living in both our countries. Following my trip to Cuba, I visited Argentina, which has begun advancing ambitious reforms to spur economic growth and has pledged to help address important global challenges, such as peacekeeping and the Syrian refugee crisis.</FP>

  <FP>Across the board, the United States has deepened our engagement in the Americas. We initiated the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to encourage more exchanges between our hemisphere's students. Last year, I launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, which will address opportunity gaps that persist for too many of our neighboring nations' youth by empowering them with the tools and resources they need to reach their full potential. Just as our countries must foster hope and prosperity, we must also address serious challenges. We will continue defending and <PRTPAGE P="66"/>strengthening civil society, because when all our people have a voice in shaping the future of our hemisphere, we all do better. The United States is working with Colombia to reduce violence and achieve peace, as we do throughout Central America. We will also keep coordinating with the nations of the Americas to prevent, detect, and respond to the spread of Zika. And later this year, I look forward to joining other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru for the next Economic Leaders' meeting.</FP>
  <FP>Millions of people in the United States are tied to the rest of the countries in our hemisphere through commerce and family. We are more than just nations—we are neighbors, bound in common cause and possibility not by our leaders, but by the citizens of the Americas and the interests we share. Let us move forward, as one people, in a spirit of unity and cooperation. Together, we can reach a future in which every young person—from Argentina to Alaska—knows peace, dignity, and opportunity, and can embark on paths that stretch beyond their neighborhood and into the wider Western Hemisphere and the entire world.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2016, as Pan American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2016, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Under the flag of the United States, generations of women and men, united in a common cause greater than themselves, have served to defend the ideals that bind us together as a Nation and that preserve our country as a beacon of hope and freedom around the world. On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we salute the selfless service members throughout our history who gave of their own liberty to ensure ours, and we renew our commitment to remaining a Nation worthy of their extraordinary sacrifices.</FP>

  <FP>In wars and engagements since America's founding, brave patriots have experienced indescribable suffering as prisoners of war. Often physically and mentally tortured, starved, and put through the worst most of us could imagine, these heroes are owed a debt we can never fully repay, and their <PRTPAGE P="67"/>families—who exhibited tremendous fortitude in the face of grueling uncertainty—are worthy of our profound gratitude. The values of honor, courage, and selflessness that drive our Armed Forces are particularly acute in those who have been taken as prisoners of war, sustaining them through days, weeks, and sometimes years of profound hardship endured for the sake of securing the blessings of liberty for all.</FP>
  <FP>America's former prisoners of war—and all who don our uniform to keep us safe—have helped make our Nation the strongest and most prosperous in the history of the world. Our eternal obligation is to care for them and uphold our everlasting promise to never leave our men and women on the battlefield behind. Let us reaffirm our adherence to these ideals and honor our former prisoners of war by paying them the gratitude and respect they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2016, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day of remembrance by honoring all American prisoners of war, our service members, and our veterans. I also call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9422</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Equal Pay Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation is built on the basic promise of a fair shot for all our people. Women in the United States still do not always receive equal pay for equal work. When women are paid less for doing the same jobs as men, it undermines our most fundamental beliefs as Americans. Every year, we mark how far into the new year women would have to work in order to earn the same as men did in the previous year, and on this day, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring equal pay for all.</FP>

  <FP>Although small gains have been made in recent years, the typical woman working full-time, year-round earns only 79 cents for every dollar earned by the typical man, and women of color earn even less relative to the typical white, non-Hispanic man—60 cents on the dollar for the typical black woman and 55 cents on the dollar for the typical Hispanic woman. Women are increasingly the breadwinners of American households, and when they are not paid equally, or are underrepresented in certain higher-paying occupations, their ability to save for retirement is hindered and hardworking families face greater difficulty meeting their basic financial needs. Pay discrimination puts greater strain on families to cover costs like child care or <PRTPAGE P="68"/>health care, and it holds our economy back from achieving its full potential. We must continue taking action to address issues of equal pay, pay secrecy, pregnancy discrimination, and unconscious bias. The gender pay gap in the United States is among the largest of many industrialized nations, and because women make up nearly half our workforce, this disparity impacts us all. The pay gap between men and women offends our values as Americans, and as long as it exists, our businesses, our communities, and our Nation will suffer the consequences.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to reaching a day in which all women are paid equally for their work. Earlier this year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in partnership with the Department of Labor, announced a new proposal to gather pay data by race, ethnicity, and gender from businesses with at least 100 employees. This will help businesses make sure their employees are being treated equally, and it will help us enforce existing equal pay laws. This proposal originated in part with my National Equal Pay Task Force, which has helped coordinate a Federal effort to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. Our Nation has taken significant steps toward achieving pay equity over the last 7 years—from the first piece of legislation I signed as President, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to challenge unequal pay, to my Executive Order prohibiting Federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss their compensation. But much work remains to be done, which is why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act—a commonsense measure that would bolster the ability of women to fight pay discrimination.</FP>
  <FP>When all people know their country is invested in their success, we are all better off. Together, we must rid our society of the injustice that is pay discrimination and restore the promise that is the right of every American: the idea that with hard work, anyone can reach for their dreams and know no limits but the scope of their aspirations. On National Equal Pay Day, we renew our belief in equal pay for equal work, and we rededicate ourselves to building a future in which women are paid based on their merits.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2016, as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9423</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Sewall-Belmont House (House), located at 144 Constitution Avenue, Northeast, in Washington, D.C.—a few steps from the U.S. Capitol—has been home to the National Woman's Party (NWP) since 1929. From this House, the NWP's founder Alice Paul wrote new language in 1943 for the Equal Rights Amendment, which became known as the “Alice Paul Amendment,” and led the fight for its passage in the Congress. From here, throughout the 20th century, Paul and the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights and advocated tirelessly for women's political, social, and economic equality not just in the United States but also internationally.</FP>
  <FP>While the House's role in women's history makes it a nationally significant resource, the building itself has an interesting past. Robert Sewall constructed the House on Jenkins Hill, known today as Capitol Hill, around 1800. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin used the House during the Jefferson Administration, and the House was the site of the only resistance to the British invasion of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. In retaliation, the British set fire to the House, but by 1820, Sewall had rebuilt it. The House remained in the Sewall family until 1922, when it was acquired by Vermont Senator Porter Dale.</FP>
  <FP>The NWP purchased the House in 1929 to serve as its headquarters. The NWP named it the “Alva Belmont House” in honor of its former president and major benefactor who had helped purchase the NWP's previous headquarters. A prominent suffragist herself, Belmont said of the new headquarters, “may it stand for years and years to come, telling of the work that the women of the United States have accomplished; the example we have given foreign nations; and our determination that they shall be—as ourselves—free citizens, recognized as the equals of men.” What is now called the Sewall-Belmont House became the staging ground for the NWP's advocacy for an equal rights amendment and other significant domestic and international action for women's equality.</FP>
  <FP>Alice Paul, the women's suffrage and equal rights leader closely associated with the Sewall-Belmont House, led the NWP from its headquarters at the House from 1929 to 1972. A Quaker and well educated, before her work in the United States, Paul had been inspired by the women's suffrage movement in Britain in the early 20th century. During her years there from 1907 to 1910, she joined with Emmeline Pankhurst, her daughters, and other suffragettes to secure the vote for British women. Paul's participation in meetings, demonstrations, and depositions to Parliament led to multiple arrests, hunger strikes, and force-feedings.</FP>

  <FP>Paul brought home her focus on women's suffrage when she returned to the United States in 1910. After earning a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1912, she devoted herself to the American suffrage movement. She feared that the movement was waning at the national <PRTPAGE P="70"/>level because efforts had shifted to State suffrage. Paul believed that the movement needed to concentrate on the passage of a Federal suffrage amendment to the United States Constitution.</FP>
  <FP>Paul became a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and by 1912 served as the chair of its Congressional Committee in Washington, D.C. In 1913, she and Lucy Burns created a larger organization, the Congressional Union of Woman Suffrage, which soon disagreed with NAWSA over tactics. The Congressional Union split from NAWSA in 1914 and evolved into the NWP through steps taken in 1916 and 1917.</FP>
  <FP>Paul was the most prominent figure in the final phase of the battle for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1920, granting women the right to vote. As part of her strategy, she adopted the philosophy to “hold the party in power responsible” from her work on women's suffrage in Britain. The NWP withheld its support from the existing political parties until women gained the right to vote, and “punished” those parties in power that did not support suffrage. In 1913, the day before Woodrow Wilson's first inauguration, Paul organized a women's suffrage parade of more than 5,000 participants from every State in the Union. Through a series of dramatic nonviolent protests, the NWP demanded that President Wilson and the Congress address women's issues. The NWP organized “Silent Sentinels” to stand outside the White House holding banners inscribed with incendiary phrases directed toward President Wilson. The colorful, spirited suffrage marches, the suffrage songs, the violence the women faced as they were physically attacked and had their banners torn from their hands, the daily pickets and arrests at the White House, the recurring jail time, the hunger strikes which resulted in force-feedings and brutal prison conditions, the national speaking tours, and newspaper headlines all created enormous public support for suffrage.</FP>
  <FP>Through most of the last century, the NWP remained a leading advocate of women's political, social, and economic equality. Following ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NWP, under the leadership of Alice Paul, turned its attention towards the larger issue of complete equality of men and women under the law. Paul reorganized the NWP in 1922 to focus on eliminating all discrimination against women. In 1923, at the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, Paul proposed an equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which became known as the “Lucretia Mott Amendment,” and launched the campaign to win full equality for women. In 1943, Alice Paul rewrote the amendment, which then became known as the “Alice Paul Amendment.” What we now refer to as the “Equal Rights Amendment” was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it finally passed in 1972, though it still has not been ratified by the required majority: three-fourths of the States.</FP>

  <FP>Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights for women on the State and local levels, including bills covering divorce and custody rights, jury service, property rights, ability to enter into contracts, and the retention of one's maiden name after marriage. It launched two major “Women for Congress” campaigns in 1924 and 1926 and lobbied for the appointment of women to high Federal positions. The NWP also worked for Federal and State <PRTPAGE P="71"/>“blanket bills” to ensure women equal rights and helped change Federal laws to equalize nationality and citizenship laws for women. The NWP fought successfully for the repeal of a statute that prohibited Federal employees from working for the Federal Government if their spouses also were Federal employees. The NWP helped eliminate many of the sex discrimination clauses in the “codes of fair competition” established under the New Deal's National Recovery Administration, and assisted in the adoption of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Paul and the NWP also played a role in getting language protecting women included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</FP>
  <FP>Alice Paul and the NWP did not limit their fight for women's rights to domestic arenas but also became active in international feminism as early as the 1920s. Among other actions, in 1938 Paul formed the World Woman's Party, which served as the NWP's international organization. It first assisted Jewish women fleeing the Holocaust and then became the NWP's office for promoting equal rights for women around the world. The NWP helped both Puerto Rican and Cuban women in seeking the vote, and in 1945 advocated successfully for the incorporation of language on women's equality in the United Nations Charter and for the establishment of a permanent United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.</FP>
  <FP>The political strategies and tactics of Alice Paul and the NWP became a blueprint for civil rights organizations and activities throughout the 20th century. In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization and became a non-profit, educational organization. Today, the House tells the story of a century of courageous activism by American women.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Park Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our National Parks have allowed generations to discover history, nature, and wildlife in irreplaceable ways. From the highest peaks of Denali to the lowest dips of the Grand Canyon, families around our country enjoy the splendor of the outdoors. Throughout National Park Week, as we celebrate the ways in which our treasured outdoor spaces enrich our lives and uplift our spirits, the National Park Service will again offer free admission to America's National Parks so more people can explore our country's vast natural beauty.</FP>
  <FP>National Parks provide unique opportunities to connect with one another and the world around us, and my Administration has encouraged more Americans to take advantage of these wonders. Through the “Find Your Park” campaign, we are helping more people visit public lands and landmarks—from State and local parks that capture our Nation's natural beauty to historical sites that offer unparalleled perspectives into our past. Whether breathtaking sceneries or rushing bodies of water, our National Parks have something for everyone—young and old—and I am committed to helping all Americans discover the outdoors and interact with our unique and magical landscapes.</FP>
  <FP>Exposure to the outdoors can stimulate thought and inspiration, and my Administration has been working to provide more of our young people with the opportunity to grow to learn and love our National Parks. We launched the “Every Kid in a Park” initiative, giving all fourth grade students and their families free admission to our parks and other Federal lands and waters. Our parks are beloved parts of America, and ensuring their survival for generations to come is imperative, which is why I have acted to protect more public land and water than any President in history—more than 265 million acres—and I have called on the Congress to boost maintenance and modernization of our National Parks so our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy their magnificence. And because we must protect the one and only planet we have, my Administration will continue working to combat climate change.</FP>
  <FP>This week, in honor of the upcoming National Park Service (NPS) centennial and the rich heritage the NPS has helped protect, let us embrace the opportunity to participate in a variety of scientific, artistic, and athletic activities in our National Parks. And together, let us recommit to promoting environmental stewardship and conserving our public lands so all our daughters and sons can experience the grandeur of our outdoor spaces for years to come.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16 through April 24, 2016, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to visit their National Parks and be reminded of these unique blessings we share as a Nation.<PRTPAGE P="76"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation has long been driven by the promise that anyone willing to work hard can make of their lives what they will, and ensuring opportunity is within reach for all requires us to provide every young person with access to a high-quality education. Our future is written in our classrooms, and on Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we reaffirm our belief that no matter who they are, where they come from, or what they look like, every child deserves an education that will help them develop their unique talents and passions, dream beyond their present circumstances, and unlock their greatest potential.</FP>
  <FP>Investing in the education of our daughters and sons is among the best investments we can make as a Nation. My Administration has worked to expand high-quality early education—something that can pay off over a child's entire lifetime—and we have proposed a plan to offer 2 years of free community college to anyone willing to work for it, because in America, a quality education cannot be a privilege reserved for a few. Last year, I was proud to sign the Every Student Succeeds Act—bipartisan legislation that will help prepare more of our young people to seize tomorrow's possibilities. By adopting higher academic standards, increasing accountability for underperforming schools, making testing more efficient, and empowering State and local leaders to develop their own systems for school improvement based on evidence, rather than impose piecemeal solutions to serious problems, this law provides schools across America with the resources and flexibility needed for students to thrive. And earlier this year, I announced Computer Science for All, a collaborative effort to give every child in America the opportunity to learn computer science, and in the time since, a growing coalition of businesses, school leaders, and State and local governments have joined this initiative.</FP>

  <FP>As we continue to build strong foundations for our students here at home, we recognize those around the world who are prevented from obtaining a quality education. That is why my Administration launched the <E T="03">Let Girls Learn</E> initiative, spearheaded by First Lady Michelle Obama, to help adolescent girls worldwide get the quality education they need to reach their full potential. Through this campaign, we are helping to break down barriers for girls across the globe and working to shift attitudes and beliefs, affirm the inherent dignity and worth of every child, and harness the power of our society to rise above our present obstacles to forge the future we know is possible.<PRTPAGE P="77"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The advances we have made in education are a result of the many educators, administrators, and advocates who have opened the doors of opportunity for countless young people. Today, we pay special tribute to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, for his tireless devotion to extending access to education to more people—regardless of their gender or background.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Earth Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On April 22, 1970, millions of people from every corner of our country joined in common cause to demand basic protections to safeguard our planet for future generations. The first Earth Day helped transform the ways we interact with the world around us, and it changed how we view our impact on the natural world—inspiring the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and landmark legislation that protects the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the animals that live alongside us. Today, we resolve to build on the progress made in the nearly half-century since, and we reaffirm our commitment to leaving a clean, healthy Earth for our children and grandchildren.</FP>
  <FP>Just as the people who came together on Earth Day in 1970 embraced their responsibility to preserve our planet, today we face a threat that also requires collective action. Human activity is disrupting the climate, and the challenge of combating climate change is one that will define the contours of our time. The effects of climate change are already evident in stronger storms, deeper droughts, more rapidly eroding soil, and longer wildfire seasons—and as of last year, 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. This urgent threat will worsen with each passing year unless we act now.</FP>

  <FP>No country can solve this challenge alone. This Earth Day, nations from across the globe are gathering in New York to sign an agreement reached <PRTPAGE P="78"/>by nearly 200 countries in Paris late last year that establishes an enduring framework to reduce global carbon pollution and set the world on a path to a low-carbon future. Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledge to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius at most, and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Science tells us these levels will help prevent some of the most devastating impacts of climate change, including more frequent and extreme droughts, storms, fires, and floods, as well as catastrophic increases in sea level.</FP>
  <FP>The Paris Agreement demonstrates what is possible when the world is united by a common concern and a shared purpose. The Agreement sets ambitious and specific targets for each nation that are necessary to solving the climate crisis. It applies to all countries, establishes meaningful accountability and reporting requirements, and brings countries back to the table every 5 years to grow their commitments as markets change and technologies improve. It also provides financing mechanisms so developing economies can move forward using clean energy, and it creates a collaborative process through which countries can establish and achieve their targets.</FP>
  <FP>Key to reaching the Paris Agreement was principled American leadership. Over the past decade, the United States has cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. We are committed to upholding our responsibility in the global effort to combat climate change and protect our planet, and my Administration has taken action to reduce our carbon pollution and lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy future. For example, we have made significant investments in clean energy—since I took Office, the amount of electricity generated from wind energy has tripled, and the amount generated from solar energy has increased more than thirtyfold. Last year, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our country's power plants. To prepare for the impacts of climate change that we cannot prevent, we are working with States and cities to help communities build climate-resilient infrastructure. And I have protected more public lands and waters than any other President in history—more than 265 million acres.</FP>
  <FP>We each have a role to play in ensuring that we do not pass a world beyond repair on to our children. Everyone must do their part, and as long as we unite to protect the one planet we have, we can leave it in better shape for future generations. On Earth Day, let us all accept our individual responsibilities to care for the world we live in, and let us marshal our best efforts toward building a safer, more stable, and more sustainable world.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2016, as Earth Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in programs and activities that will protect our environment and contribute to a healthy, sustainable future.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For generations, sports have brought Americans of all ages together and helped us celebrate our country's competitive spirit. When we work to instill an appreciation for physical fitness in our people, we do more than honor an age-old tradition—we take a critical step toward ensuring the prospect of a long and healthy life. During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we highlight the importance of staying active, and we encourage all Americans to partake in physical activity to maintain their health and well-being.</FP>
  <FP>Sports and other forms of physical activity inspire us—they bridge differences, unite Americans from every walk of life, and teach the importance of teamwork. Whether exploring the great outdoors or shooting hoops with friends, regular physical activity can also relieve stress, boost energy and self-esteem, and prevent numerous chronic diseases, including some of the leading causes of death, such as cancer, stroke, and heart disease. Children should engage in physical activity for at least 1 hour each day, and adults should do so for at least 30 minutes. Critical to enabling our youth to reach their fullest potential, regular exercise must go hand-in-hand with healthy eating and proper nutrition—because our children's well-being tomorrow depends on what they eat today.</FP>

  <FP>This year, we celebrate six decades since President Dwight Eisenhower established the President's Council on Youth Fitness, known today as the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition. The Council partners with the public, private, and non-profit sectors to empower people to lead healthy and active lives. Through their <E T="03">I Can Do It, You Can Do It!</E> program, the Council facilitates physical activity for individuals with disabilities and offers opportunities for regular exercise at sites across our country. My Administration's <E T="03">Go4Life</E> campaign is motivating older Americans to recommit to making exercise a part of their daily lives. And First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative continues to inspire a rising generation to eat healthily and get plenty of physical activity so they can grow up strong and pursue their dreams. For more information on my Administration's actions to promote sports and physical fitness—and for ways you can get involved—visit www.Fitness.gov and www.LetsMove.gov.</FP>
  <FP>Participation in sports and other physical activity represents our country's promise: the idea that if you work hard, commit to a goal, and never give up on yourself, there is nothing you cannot achieve. This month, let us each strive to make fitness a greater part of our lives, and let us join together as one American team to promote physical activity and chart a healthier, fitter future for our country.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good nutrition a priority in their lives.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Law Day, U.S.A., 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Underpinning American democracy and upholding the founding principles of our Nation, the law enshrines our bedrock belief in equality and justice for all. Central to securing these ideals is ensuring that every American's fundamental, constitutionally-guaranteed individual rights are protected, and by respecting these rights, our Nation demonstrates its unwavering dedication to the law. Our fidelity to the rule of law has guided our country in times of trial and triumph, and it helps us keep faith with our Founders and with generations to come.</FP>

  <FP>On this year's Law Day, we celebrate 50 years since the Supreme Court's ruling in <E T="03">Miranda</E> v. <E T="03">Arizona.</E> This landmark decision made clear that the Fifth Amendment “. . . serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.” <E T="03">Miranda</E> v. <E T="03">Arizona</E> institutionalized the important practice of explaining constitutional rights prior to interrogation. And it established the important general rule that individuals interrogated in police custody cannot have their answers admitted into evidence against them unless they had first been informed of their rights—including the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney present.</FP>
  <FP>The Court's decision in <E T="03">Miranda</E> v. <E T="03">Arizona</E> affirmed that “Equal Justice Under Law” is more than just words, but a cornerstone of our Nation's legal system—the idea that no matter who you are or where you come from, you will be treated equally and afforded due process. Today, our society faces new challenges to this age-old tenet. Our criminal justice system is in serious need of reform; disparities in stops, arrests, and sentencing persist; and in too many places distrust exists between community members and law enforcement officers. I am committed to ensuring our Nation's criminal justice system is fair, smart, and effective. By engaging people across America, my Task Force on 21st Century Policing has provided a roadmap for strengthening relationships between local police and the communities they serve, helping to uphold the integrity of our criminal justice system. My Administration has also taken action to address unfair sentencing disparities that undermine the equitable application of the law, and we will continue working to bring greater fairness to our criminal justice system and to ensure that the rule of law remains the foundation of our country.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="03">Miranda</E> v. <E T="03">Arizona</E> imparts an important lesson: Knowledge of our constitutional rights is an essential component to fully exercising those rights. Safeguarding the promise of equal justice requires the participation of all <PRTPAGE P="81"/>our citizens, and across America, community and court programs that offer civic education and prepare members of the public to fulfill their civic responsibilities are vital to this task.</FP>

  <FP>Chief Justice Earl Warren, the author of the Supreme Court's decision in <E T="03">Miranda</E> v. <E T="03">Arizona,</E> once observed that, “In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics.” The law informs right from wrong—it affects the daily reality of our lives and safeguards the birthrights of all Americans. On Law Day, let us recommit to building a future rooted in the rule of law, in which our laws apply equally to everyone and all our children know a fair and just world.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2016, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Loyalty Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America endures because of the generations of our people who have endeavored alongside one another, joining their voices and their efforts to ensure our Nation lives up to its highest ideals. Driven by the determination to continue making our society more just and more equal, our work to fulfill our country's potential has always relied on our willingness to see ourselves in our fellow citizens.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation has always been at its finest when guided by a spirit of shared sacrifice and common purpose. It is that spirit that led a small band of patriots to declare our fledgling democracy free from the grasp of tyranny, that slaves and abolitionists carried in their hearts as they marched forward on the long journey toward freedom, and that guides the men and women who wear our country's uniform in their selfless service. From the unlit paths of the Underground Railroad to the lunch counters of Greensboro, the first streets draped in the colors of pride to the highest Court in our land, we have seen throughout our history that America is inexorably driven forward by those who commit themselves to expanding our founding promise through extraordinary acts of courage and heroism. We honor that legacy—that demonstrates that the forces of hope and love of country are strong enough to overcome even our most deeply entrenched obstacles—by resolving to carry it forward, by rejecting appeals to prejudice and division in our time, and by drawing on the hopes and dreams that bind us.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>While ours has always been a large and complicated democracy, full of differing views and boisterous debates, our history also makes clear that we are strongest when we find in our diversity a deeper, richer unity, stemming from an overarching belief in the possibilities our shared future holds. This Loyalty Day, let us remember that what defines us as one American people is our dedication to common ideals—rather than similarities of origin or creed—and let us reaffirm that embracing this truth lies at the heart of what it means to be a citizen. As long as we stay true to that mission and uphold our responsibility to deliver a freer, fairer Nation to the next generation, a future of ever greater progress will remain within our reach.</FP>
  <FP>In order to recognize the American spirit of loyalty and the sacrifices that so many have made for our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as “Loyalty Day.” On this day, let us reaffirm our allegiance to the United States of America and pay tribute to the heritage of American freedom.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2016, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty Day, I call upon all the people of the United States to join in support of this national observance, whether by displaying the flag of the United States or pledging allegiance to the Republic for which it stands.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Workers Memorial Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The story of America is the story of its workers. With faith in one another and hope for what their country could be, generations of laborers fought, sacrificed, and organized for the rights and protections that workers across our Nation have today—including requirements to protect their health and safety. Today, we honor this legacy by reflecting on those who have lost their lives in the workplace, and we reaffirm our dedication to ensuring that people can work knowing the fullest measure of stability, security, and opportunity.</FP>

  <FP>In 1969 and 1970, two pieces of legislation of enormous consequence forever changed the lives of workers across our Nation. Passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Republican President, the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act—which required Federal inspections of coal mines, established processes and protections for ensuring the health and safety of coal miners, and was later amended to cover all miners—and the Occupational Safety and Health Act—which created new standards for worker protections in industries across America—represented milestone <PRTPAGE P="83"/>achievements for a cause borne out of decades of toil and struggle. Spurred by working men and women of every origin and background, the movement for worker safety was inspired by a simple notion: that those who contribute so much to the economy and spirit of our country should have every chance to share in its promise.</FP>
  <FP>Since I took office, my Administration has advanced protections for America's workers. In 2014, I signed an Executive Order aimed at cracking down on Federal contractors who violate our labor laws, and in the time since, we have enhanced our rigorous processes for companies contracting with the Federal Government while working to enforce and raise standards for employers throughout our economy. We have implemented rules that cut the amount of coal dust inhaled by coal miners, and we have taken steps to protect more workers from diseases caused by exposure to silica and other harmful substances. And we will enhance our efforts to support workers injured on the job, because if you are hurt at the workplace after giving your all, you should still be able to keep food on the table.</FP>
  <FP>The history of America's workers reminds us that, far from being inevitable, the progress each generation has known has been the result of the courage, determination, and solidarity demonstrated by the last. This Workers Memorial Day, as we join in solemn remembrance of those who lost their lives undertaking their labor, let us carry forward the vision of just and safe working conditions for all of America's workers. If we stay true to that essential mission, we can deliver to our children and grandchildren a future of ever greater possibility and security.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2016, as Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in ceremonies and activities in memory of those killed or injured due to unsafe working conditions.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Jewish American Heritage Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>At America's birth, our Founders fought off tyranny and declared a set of ideals—including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—that would forever guide our country's course. For generations since, Jewish Americans, having shared in the struggle for freedom, have been instrumental in ensuring our Nation stays true to the principles enshrined in our founding <PRTPAGE P="84"/>documents. They have helped bring about enduring progress in every aspect of our society, shaping our country's character and embodying the values we hold dear. This month, as we pay tribute to their indelible contributions, we recommit to ridding our world of bigotry and injustice and reflect on the extraordinary ways in which Jewish Americans have made our Union more perfect.</FP>
  <FP>Many of the Jewish people who reached our Nation's shores throughout our history did so fleeing the oppression they encountered in areas around the world. Driven by the possibility of charting a freer future, they endeavored, on their own and as a community, to make real the promise of America—in their individual lives and in the life of our country. Determined to confront the racism that kept this promise from being fully realized, many Jewish Americans found a cause in the Civil Rights Movement that—in its call for freedom and justice—echoed the timeless message of Exodus and the Jewish people's journey through the ages. Reflecting on the march in Selma, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once noted, “I felt my legs were praying.” From the fight for women's rights to LGBT rights to workers' rights, many in the Jewish American community, drawing on lessons from their own past, have trumpeted a clarion call for equality and justice.</FP>
  <FP>We cannot pay proper respect to the legacy of Jewish Americans without also reflecting on the rise of anti-Semitism in many parts of the world, and in remembering the lessons of the Holocaust, we recognize the imperative need to root out prejudice. Subjecting men, women, and children to persecution on the basis of their ancestry and faith, the scourge of anti-Semitism demands that we declare through action and solidarity that an attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths. That is why the United States is leading the international effort to combat anti-Semitism—we helped organize the first United Nations General Assembly meeting on anti-Semitism last year, and we are asking countries around the world to join us in giving this challenge the focus it demands. In celebrating Jewish Americans' contributions to our country, we also reaffirm our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security and the close bonds between our two nations and our peoples. Throughout my Administration, the multifaceted relationship between our countries has grown and strengthened to an unprecedented degree, particularly with regard to U.S.-Israeli security assistance and cooperation.</FP>
  <FP>The Jewish American experience and our Nation as a whole have always been held together by the forces of hope and resilience. During Jewish American Heritage Month, as we reflect on our past and look toward the future, let us carry forward our mutual legacy, grounded in our interconnected roots, and affirm that it is from the extraordinary richness of our bond that we draw strength. And let us renew our dedication to the work of building a fully inclusive tomorrow—one where a great diversity of origins is not only accepted, but also celebrated—here at home and around the world.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to visit www.JewishHeritageMonth.gov to learn more about the heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.<PRTPAGE P="85"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Foster Care Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The success of our country tomorrow depends on the well-being of our children today. As a Nation, we have a duty to empower each child so they have the same sense of promise and possibility as any other young person no matter who they are, where they come from, or what their circumstances are. Foster youth deserve the security and strong support structures they need to achieve their dreams. During National Foster Care Month, we lift up our Nation's foster children, celebrate the selfless men and women who embrace children in the foster care system, and we recommit to helping more children find permanency so they can feel stable, grounded, and free to fulfill their limitless potential.</FP>
  <FP>With open hearts, families and professionals across America work each day to give foster youth the resources, warmth, and care they need. Over 400,000 children remain in the foster care system, and tens of thousands of youth age out of foster care before they find their forever family. Only half of children in foster care complete high school by age 18, and less than 5 percent graduate college. Young people who age out of foster care without a permanent home are often at higher risk of entering the criminal justice system, and they can face greater challenges to completing an education, obtaining high-quality health care, and securing gainful employment. We also know kids are better off when raised by loving families, not institutions. These difficult outcomes are often exaggerated further when children are placed in group homes.</FP>
  <FP>I am committed to preventing youth from falling into these situations. I have proposed allowing child welfare agencies to use Federal funds to provide critical services and shelter to foster youth who have aged out of the system until they are 23. My Administration is also working to reduce abuse and neglect by focusing resources on strengthening families so children stay out of foster care in the first place. Children living in foster care are more likely than other children to be overprescribed medication for social-emotional and mental health disorders. That is why my Administration is encouraging greater use of evidence-based screening, assessment, and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders for kids in foster care. And because every child deserves access to quality, affordable health insurance, the Affordable Care Act requires each State to extend Medicaid coverage to foster children who have aged out of the foster care system until the age of 26.</FP>

  <FP>Children grow to become their best selves when they are surrounded by supportive families. Caretakers support foster youth and help them see a <PRTPAGE P="86"/>future of greater promise and hope. Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality, giving more kids in foster care the opportunity to be part of a loving family. My Administration will continue fighting to ensure eligible and qualified caretakers have the chance to become an adoptive or foster parent regardless of race, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The commitment and dependability of a family can provide foster youth with the confidence to write and control their own destiny. Family is the bedrock of the American story, and we must do everything we can to support all young people so they can be free from harm, healthy, and ready to chart the course of our Nation's unwritten history.</FP>
  <FP>When we create environments for all young people to grow and flourish and safely live as who they are regardless of race, background, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity our country is stronger. This month, and every month, let us pay tribute to the children in foster care and the dedicated parents and professionals who tirelessly work to shape their lives. And as a country, let us embrace the spirit that every child matters and continue working to provide all of our daughters and sons with an equal chance to lead productive and fulfilling lives, limited by nothing but the power of their imaginations and the scope of their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking time to help youth in foster care and recognizing the commitment of all who touch their lives.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Nearly 44 million American adults, and millions of children, experience mental health conditions each year, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress. Although we have made progress expanding mental health coverage and elevating the conversation about mental health, too many people still do not get the help they need. Our Nation is founded on the belief that we must look out for one another—and whether it affects our family members, friends, co-workers, or those unknown to us—we do a service for each other when we reach out and help those struggling with mental health issues. This month, we renew our commitment to ridding our society of the stigma associated with mental illness, encourage those living with mental health conditions to get the <PRTPAGE P="87"/>help they need, and reaffirm our pledge to ensure those who need help have access to the support, acceptance, and resources they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>In the last 7 years, our country has made extraordinary progress in expanding mental health coverage for more people across America. The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions, requires coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in individual and small group markets, and expands mental health and substance use disorder parity policies, which are estimated to help more than 60 million Americans. Nearly 15 million more Americans have gained Medicaid coverage since October 2013, significantly improving access to mental health care. And because of more than $100 million in funding from the Affordable Care Act, community health centers have expanded behavioral health services for nearly 900,000 people nationwide over the past 2 years. Still, far too few Americans experiencing mental illnesses do not receive the care and treatment they need. That is why my most recent Budget proposal includes a new half-billion dollar investment to improve access to mental health care, engage individuals with serious mental illness in care, and help ensure behavioral health care systems work for everyone.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation has made strong advances in improving prevention, increasing early intervention, and expanding treatment of mental illnesses. Earlier this year, I established a Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force, which aims to ensure that coverage for mental health benefits is comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care, improve understanding of the requirements of the law, and expand compliance with it. Mental health should be treated as part of a person's overall health, and we must ensure individuals living with mental health conditions can get the treatment they need. My Administration also continues to invest in science and research through the BRAIN initiative to enhance our understanding of the complexities of the human brain and to make it easier to diagnose and treat mental health disorders early.</FP>
  <FP>One of our most profound obligations as a Nation is to support the men and women in uniform who return home and continue fighting battles against mental illness. Last year, I signed the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which fills critical gaps in serving veterans with post-traumatic stress and other illnesses, increases peer support and outreach, and recruits more talented individuals to work on mental health issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This law will make it easier for veterans to get the care they need when they need it. All Americans, including service members, can get immediate assistance by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or by calling 1-800-662-HELP.</FP>
  <FP>During National Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognize those Americans who live with mental illness and substance use disorders, and we pledge solidarity with their families who need our support as well. Let us strive to ensure people living with mental health conditions know that they are not alone, that hope exists, and that the possibility of healing and thriving is real. Together, we can help everyone get the support they need to recover as they continue along the journey to get well.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National <PRTPAGE P="88"/>Mental Health Awareness Month.

  <FP>Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) are the fastest growing racial group in our country, growing over 4 times as rapidly as the population of the United States. As one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse groups in America, the AAPI community reminds us that though we all have distinct backgrounds and origins, we are bound in common purpose by our shared hopes and dreams for ourselves and our children. Our Nation's story would be incomplete without the voices of countless Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders who have called the land we all love home. This month, we honor the irreplaceable roles they have played in our past, and we recommit to ensuring opportunities exist for generations of AAPIs to come.</FP>
  <FP>The AAPI community's long and deeply-rooted legacy in the United States reminds us of both proud and painful chapters of our history. Confronted with grueling and perilous working conditions, thousands of Chinese laborers on the transcontinental railroad pushed the wheels of progress forward in the West. Japanese American troops fought for freedom from tyranny abroad in World War II while their families here at home were interned simply on the basis of their origin. And many South Asian Americans in particular face discrimination, harassment, and senseless violence often in the communities in which they live and work.</FP>
  <FP>Today, AAPIs lend their rich heritage to enhancing our communities and our culture. As artists and activists, educators and elected officials, service men and women and business owners, AAPIs help drive our country forward. Yet despite hard-won achievements, AAPIs continue to face obstacles to realizing their full potential. One in three AAPIs does not speak English fluently, and certain subgroups experience low levels of educational attainment and high levels of unemployment. AAPIs also often experience heightened health risks, and millions of AAPI men, women, and children in the United States live in poverty.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is committed to supporting and investing in AAPI communities. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million uninsured adults have gained health insurance coverage, including 2 million AAPIs. Among Asian Americans under the age of 65, the uninsured rate has declined by <PRTPAGE P="89"/>55 percent since 2013. Last year, we brought together thousands of AAPI artists; advocates; and business, community, and Federal leaders from across America for the first-ever White House Summit on AAPIs to discuss the key issues facing their communities. The Summit was hosted by the White House Initiative on AAPIs, which I reestablished during my first year in office and is housed within the Department of Education. We are working with Federal agencies to build stronger and more robust regional networks across our country that improve access to Federal resources and expand opportunities. We have worked to protect civil rights, foster educational equity, and create economic opportunity across our country. Because a lack of detailed data perpetuates the false notion of AAPIs as a model minority, we are working across Government to improve data collection to counter existing stereotypes and to shed light on the realities faced and resources needed by the AAPI community. Through the White House Task Force on New Americans, Federal agencies are working with cities and counties around America to build welcoming communities that allow immigrants and refugees to thrive. And we will continue working to allow more high-skilled immigrants to stay in our country—too many talented AAPIs are held back from fully realizing our country's promise, and too many have suffered the consequences of our Nation's broken immigration system.</FP>
  <FP>Peoples of diverse backgrounds and circumstances have long come to our country with the faith that they could build a better life in America, and spanning generations, the story of AAPIs in the United States embodies this promise. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, let us celebrate the many contributions our AAPI brothers and sisters have made to the American mosaic, and let us renew our commitment to creating more opportunities for AAPI youth as they grow up and embrace the hard work of active citizenship, adding their unique voices and experiences to our Nation's narrative.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/AAPI to learn more about our efforts on behalf of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Building Safety Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Buildings across our country provide safety and shelter to our people. From high-rises that form our cities' skylines to ranch homes that blanket the countryside, our buildings offer places to gather and perform daily activities, and they must have sound, secure, and resilient structures. During National Building Safety Month, we recognize and pay tribute to those who ensure the safety and resilience of our Nation's buildings, and we reaffirm our commitment to upholding and abiding by strong and effective building safety standards.</FP>
  <FP>Maintaining the safety and resilience of our homes and buildings is imperative. By using disaster-resistant building codes and standards, resilient construction materials, and safe and performance-based design methods, we can safeguard the workplaces, houses, schools, and other facilities that provide us with space to grow, live, and learn. Americans can also take steps to secure buildings before natural disasters strike by elevating properties where necessary, anchoring furniture and other materials, reinforcing doors, and covering windows. I encourage everyone to visit www.Ready.gov to learn about more ways to keep yourself and those around you safe in your homes and businesses.</FP>
  <FP>The Federal Government is leading by example. To prepare for natural disasters, I have signed Executive Orders that strengthen the security of Federal buildings and assets and improve their resilience to floods and earthquakes, reduce the risks of harm to people, lower recovery costs, and make it easier for communities to recover faster and emerge stronger. Later this month, the White House will bring together collaborators from the public and private sectors at a Conference on Resilient Building Codes. This event will underscore the critical role building codes play in ensuring community resilience, and it will strengthen our national commitment to advancing resilience in the built environment, from codes and standards to building design and construction.</FP>
  <FP>The consequences of natural disasters can be exacerbated by the effects of a changing climate—including through stronger storms and longer wildfire seasons—so it is crucial that we ensure our buildings are resilient to the impacts of climate change. My Administration has worked with communities to build climate-resilient infrastructure to prepare for the impacts of climate change that we can no longer prevent, and we are continuing to invest in energy efficiency in our buildings.</FP>
  <FP>All people deserve to feel safe in the buildings we inhabit day in and day out. With care and attention, we can secure and protect the places we spend time in. This month, let us take action to safeguard America's homes, schools, and other buildings, and let us ensure those responsible for this important work have the tools and resources they need.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National <PRTPAGE P="91"/>Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise awareness about building safety. I also call on all Americans to learn more about how they can contribute to building safety at home and in their communities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Older Americans Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Through a lifetime of contribution, older Americans have helped ensure that the founding promise of our country remains within reach for their children and grandchildren, and their individual narratives reflect the extraordinary history of our Nation. This month, we celebrate our Nation's older citizens, and we show our appreciation for all they have done to enrich our communities and drive America forward.</FP>
  <FP>Older Americans have unique knowledge and a breadth of insights that are tremendous assets to our country—and our seniors are eager to impart the wisdom learned from their experiences. Across our country, older Americans work and volunteer in their communities, challenging younger Americans' ambitions for what they can hope to achieve in their golden years. We must maximize the contributions of our seniors and ensure they have the resources and support they need to thrive and to keep shaping the future of the country they love.</FP>

  <FP>The population of the United States is transforming rapidly. Within the next 13 years, more than one in five Americans will be of retirement age, and our Nation must make it a priority to ensure they are able to retire and live with dignity and respect. I remain committed to strengthening Medicare and Social Security—hallmark programs that enabled an entire generation of older Americans to live with stability and security. Aging affects us all, and I am dedicated to empowering more of today's seniors and future seniors. In 2014, I launched <E T="03">my</E>RA, a new type of savings bond that allows more of our people to save for retirement. And earlier this year, I was proud to sign a reauthorization of the Older Americans Act—providing critical support for the services seniors depend on to maintain their health and independence.</FP>

  <FP>Our country has an obligation to make sure older Americans can enjoy the opportunities that come with aging, and my Administration is committed to supporting our seniors. Last summer, we held the White House Conference on Aging, where we announced our plans to modernize Federal <PRTPAGE P="92"/>rules affecting older Americans, improve access to workplace-based retirement plans, and better utilize technology to enrich the lives of older Americans. We launched www.Aging.gov—a resource for government-wide information for older adults to lead independent and fulfilling lives. And we have proposed updating quality and safety requirements for thousands of nursing homes, making it easier for homebound individuals to get nutritional assistance, and training more prosecutors to combat elder abuse.</FP>
  <FP>One of the best measures of a country is how it treats its older citizens. During Older Americans Month, let us pay tribute to the men and women who raised, guided, and inspired us, and let us honor their enduring contributions to our society by safeguarding their rights and the opportunities they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Older Americans Month. I call upon Americans of all ages to celebrate the contributions of older Americans during this month and throughout the year.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Charter Schools Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation has always been guided by the belief that all young people should be free to dream as big and boldly as they want, and that with hard work and determination, they can turn their dreams into realities. Schools help us uphold this ideal by offering a place for children to grow, learn, and thrive. During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate the role of high-quality public charter schools in helping to ensure students are prepared and able to seize their piece of the American dream, and we honor the dedicated professionals across America who make this calling their life's work by serving in charter schools.</FP>

  <FP>Charter schools play an important role in our country's education system. Supporting some of our Nation's underserved communities, they can ignite imagination and nourish the minds of America's young people while finding new ways of educating them and equipping them with the knowledge they need to succeed. With the flexibility to develop new methods for educating our youth, and to develop remedies that could help underperforming schools, these innovative and autonomous public schools often offer lessons that can be applied in other institutions of learning across our country, including in traditional public schools. We also must ensure our charter schools, like all our schools, are of high quality and are held accountable—when a charter school does not meet high standards, we need to act <PRTPAGE P="93"/>in the best interest of its students to help it improve, and if that does not prove possible, to close its doors.</FP>
  <FP>Charter schools have been at the forefront of innovation and have found different ways of engaging students in their high school years—including by providing personalized instruction, leveraging technology, and giving students greater access to rigorous coursework and college-level courses. Over the past 7 years, my Administration's commitment of resources to the growth of charter schools has enabled a significant expansion of educational opportunity, enabling tens of thousands of children to attend high-quality public charter schools. I am committed to ensuring all of our Nation's students have the tools and skills they need to get ahead, and that begins with ensuring they are able to attend an effective school and obtain an excellent education.</FP>
  <FP>Educating every American student and ensuring they graduate from high school prepared for college and beyond is a national priority. This week, we honor the educators working in public charter schools across our Nation who, each day, give of themselves to provide children a fair shot at the American dream, and we recommit to the basic promise that all our daughters and sons—regardless of background or circumstance—should be able to make of their lives what they will.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to support high-quality public schools, including charter schools, and the students they serve.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Small Business Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Responsible for creating nearly two-thirds of net new jobs in the United States each year and employing more than half of all Americans, small businesses have always been a vital part of our country's economy. As outlets for creativity and ingenuity, small businesses do more than create jobs and foster growth—they represent the spirit that has always driven our Nation forward. Throughout National Small Business Week, we celebrate the irreplaceable role these enterprises play in our national life by pledging to support them and equip them with the tools and resources they need to succeed.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Across America, small businesses support economies, employ local residents, and contribute to the vibrancy of their communities. My Administration is dedicated to helping these businesses and the entrepreneurs who took a chance on turning ideas into realities. We have enacted 18 tax cuts for small businesses, and because of the Affordable Care Act, a tax credit of up to 50 percent is available for certain small businesses to help offset the cost of insurance. And our businesses have created jobs in every month since I signed this law.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation does best when we help our startups and small businesses expand into new markets and offer goods and services to more people. Ninety-eight percent of the American companies that export are small and medium-sized businesses, but less than 5 percent of our country's small businesses export. In our 21st-century economy, it is imperative that we break down the trade barriers that too often hold small businesses back from extending their reach to those abroad to sell more goods made in the United States. Last year, we reached an agreement with 11 other nations that allows us to write the rules of our global economy and gives more of our people the fair shot at success they deserve. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will eliminate over 18,000 taxes imposed by other countries on our goods and services and level the playing field for American workers and businesses, and I look forward to working with the Congress to implement this agreement.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has taken action to ensure the Federal Government does its part to support our Nation's small businesses. During fiscal year 2015, we awarded an all-time high of more than a quarter of eligible Federal contracts to small businesses, and we made great strides in ensuring more Government contracts are given to women-owned small businesses—nearly $18 billion worth. We have launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and we have made more online tools available to entrepreneurs to give them the resources they need to start a business in a single day—and the Startup in a Day initiative is continuing to engage with all levels of government to streamline the process of beginning a business.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's small businesses play a critical role in generating economic prosperity, and the effort poured into them by ordinary citizens across our country reflects the hard work and determination inherent to who we are as a people. This week, we renew our support for these engines of growth and recognize their incredible contributions to our country.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the competitiveness of the American economy with appropriate programs and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Teacher Appreciation Day and National Teacher Appreciation Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our country's story, written over more than two centuries, is one of challenges, chances, and progress. As our Nation has advanced on our journey toward ensuring rights and opportunities are extended fully and equally to all people, America's teachers—from the front lines of our civil rights movement to the front lines of our education system—have helped steer our country's course. They witness the incredible potential of our youth, and they know firsthand the impact of a caring leader at the front of the classroom.</FP>
  <FP>As our national narrative has progressed, we have become a more equal society, cleared paths to opportunity, and affirmed the extraordinary potential of all our people—regardless of their race, their gender, their sexual orientation, their religion, or the zip code they were born into. But there is still work to be done. If our country's story is going to reflect the diversity we draw strength from, it needs to be written by people that represent the wide range of backgrounds and origins that comprise our national mosaic, and as the next generation rises and prepares to shape that narrative, our teachers will be with them every step of the way—imparting critical knowledge and opening their minds to the possibilities tomorrow holds. In working to ensure all our daughters and sons have the chance to add their voice and perspective to America's story, our teachers help shape a Nation that better reflects the values we were founded upon.</FP>
  <FP>When I took office, I did so with a bold vision to foster innovation and drive change within our education system, and to expand educational opportunities and outcomes for all America's learners. Central to that goal is our work to build and strengthen the teaching profession so our teachers are enabled and equipped to inspire rising generations. I have worked hard throughout my Presidency to make sure my Administration does its part to support our educators and our education system, but the incredible progress our country has seen—from achieving record high graduation rates to holding more students to high standards that prepare them for success in college and future careers—is thanks to the dedicated teachers, families, and school leaders who work tirelessly on behalf of our young people.</FP>

  <FP>Just as we know a student's circumstances do not dictate his or her potential, we know that having an effective teacher is the most important in-school factor for student success. That is why my Administration has been committed to better recruiting, preparing, retraining, and rewarding America's teachers. Following the worst economic crisis our country has seen since the Great Depression, my Administration supported significant investments in education through the Recovery Act to keep more than 300,000 educators in the classroom. We have invested more than $2.7 billion through competitive grants to better recruit, train, support, and reward talented teachers and educators, and we have worked to make sure teachers have a strong voice and a seat at the table in the policymaking process. At the urging of the Department of Education, all fifty States are advancing <PRTPAGE P="96"/>teacher equity plans to ensure that districts can support and retain educators in schools that need them most. In my State of the Union address in 2011, I announced a national goal to prepare 100,000 public school STEM teachers by 2021 to help ensure more of our young innovators can seize the opportunities of tomorrow—and I am proud that we are on track to meet that goal.</FP>
  <FP>I recently signed the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which ensures students are held to high standards that will better prepare them for college and careers. And because cookie-cutter solutions are not always effective considering the diversity of our communities and of the students in our classrooms, ESSA reflects my Administration's approach to education reform by empowering States and local decision makers, who know what their students need best, to shape their own progress with accountability. ESSA also aligns with the Testing Action Plan I announced last fall to help reduce the burden of standardized testing so educators can spend less time testing and more time teaching. This law will also allow more States and districts to support teachers and expand access to computer science, a critical skill our students need in the innovation economy.</FP>
  <FP>Our future is written in schools across our country. It is likely that the first person who will go to Mars is in a classroom today. Our students are our future teachers, scientists, politicians, public servants, and parents—a generation that will steer the course we will take as a people and make possible things we have not even imagined yet. We look to the women and men standing in front of classrooms in all corners of our country—from cities to reservations to rural towns—to vest America's daughters and sons with the hard skills they will need to put their dreams within reach and to inspire them to dream even bigger. On National Teacher Appreciation Day and during National Teacher Appreciation Week, let us ensure our educators know how much we value their service in the classroom, how much we appreciate all they do for our students and families, and how thankful we are for their contributions to our national progress.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3, 2016, as National Teacher Appreciation Day and May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Teacher Appreciation Week. I call upon students, parents, and all Americans to recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation's teachers and to observe this day and this week by supporting teachers through appropriate activities, events, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Public Service Recognition Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation's progress has long been fueled by the efforts of selfless citizens who come together in service to their fellow Americans to change our country for the better. At the birth of our Nation, our Founders fought to secure a democracy that represents the people, and the civil servants who pour everything they have into making a difference are the individuals who keep that democracy running smoothly and effectively. During Public Service Recognition Week, we honor those who dedicate themselves to ensuring America's promise rings true in every corner of our country, and we recommit to upholding the values they fight for every day.</FP>
  <FP>Civil servants demonstrate resolve and inspire optimism in sectors throughout our country. They are engineers and educators, military service members and social workers, and their individual and collective contributions drive us forward on the path toward an ever brighter tomorrow. Both at home and abroad, they carry forward the notion that as Americans, we are committed to looking out for one another and to working together to forge a bright future for generations to come. And the only way our Nation's civil service will remain at the forefront of our progress is for talented and patriotic young people to join in the effort of serving their fellow Americans—whether for 1 year or throughout their career.</FP>
  <FP>Throughout this week, we recognize the tireless efforts of the women and men who strive to make sure ours is a government that stays true to its founding ideals. With 85 percent of Federal Government jobs located outside of the Washington, DC area, our Federal workers, together with leaders and advocates from State and local levels, play key roles in ensuring the voices of the American people are heard. And even in the toughest of circumstances, including a politics that does not always fully recognize the value of their work, our public servants—often at great personal sacrifice—continue striving to build a better country and to bring lasting change to the lives of ordinary people across America. These selfless individuals tackle great challenges facing our country. Whether leading important scientific advances, helping homeless veterans get off the street and reclaim their lives, supporting small businesses and impoverished communities, or sustaining our environment by reducing harmful pollutants emitted into our air and waterways, these often unsung heroes make vital contributions to our country and help make our founding promise real for more people.</FP>

  <FP>The well-being of our people depends on the passion and dedication of our workforce, and my Administration has worked to recruit, uplift, and empower exceptional civil servants. In an effort to fully realize the belief that all of us have the capacity to make a meaningful difference and contribute to our shared success, I have directed the Office of Personnel Management to begin taking action to “ban the box” on most Federal job applications so we are not disqualifying people with a criminal record simply because of a mistake they made in the past. Additionally, we are implementing programs that encourage Government-wide collaboration, giving workers a <PRTPAGE P="98"/>chance to lend and develop their talents across agencies and departments so our best ideas can flourish and grow to their fullest potential.</FP>
  <FP>Serving the public is not just about a paycheck—it's about contributing to the steady effort to perfect our Union over time so our democracy works for everyone. This week, let us embrace the hopeful spirit that embodies the extraordinary work of our civil servants. It is the same spirit that built America, and because of the hard work of compassionate and determined public servants, it will continue to build us up for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as Public Service Recognition Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Day of Prayer, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In times of steady calm and extraordinary change alike, Americans of all walks of life have long turned to prayer to seek refuge, demonstrate gratitude, and discover peace. Sustaining us through great uncertainty and moments of sorrow, prayer allows us an outlet for introspection, and for expressing our hopes, desires, and fears. It offers strength in the face of hardship, and redemption when we falter. Our country was founded on the idea of religious freedom, and we have long upheld the belief that how we pray and whether we pray are matters reserved for an individual's own conscience. On National Day of Prayer, we rededicate ourselves to extending this freedom to all people.</FP>
  <FP>Every day, women and men use the wisdom gained from humble prayer to spread kindness and to make our world a better place. Faith communities at home and abroad have helped feed the hungry, heal the sick, and protect innocents from violence. Nurturing communities with love and understanding, their prayer inspires their work, which embodies a timeless notion that has kept humanity going through the ages—that one of our most sacred responsibilities is to give of ourselves in service to others.</FP>

  <FP>The threats of poverty, violence, and war around the world are all too real. Our faith and our earnest prayers can be cures for the fear we feel as we confront these realities. Helping us resist despair, paralysis, or cynicism, prayer offers a powerful alternative to pessimism. Through prayer, we often <PRTPAGE P="99"/>gain the insight to learn from our mistakes, the motivation to always be better, and the courage to stand up for what is right, even when it is not popular.</FP>
  <FP>Each of us is an author in our collective American story, and in participating in our national discourse to address some of our Nation's greatest challenges, we are reminded of the blessing we have to live in a land where we are able to freely express the beliefs we hold in our hearts. The United States will continue to stand up for those around the world who are subject to fear or violence because of their religion or beliefs. As a Nation free to practice our faith as we choose, we must remember those around the world who are not afforded this freedom, and we must recommit to building a society where all can enjoy this liberty and live their lives in peace and dignity.</FP>
  <FP>On this day, may our faiths enable us to sow the seeds of progress in our ever-changing world. Let us resolve to guide our children and grandchildren to embrace freedom for all, to see God in everyone, and to remember that no matter what differences they may have, they, just like we, will always be united by their common humanity.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a “National Day of Prayer.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2016, as National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I join all people of faith in asking for God's continued guidance, mercy, and protection as we seek a more just world.</FP>

  <FP>Serving alongside our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, our Nation's military families give of themselves and give up their time with their loved ones so we may live safely and freely. Few Americans fully understand the sacrifices made by those who serve in uniform, but for spouses of service members across our country, the costs of the freedom we too often take for granted are known intimately.

  <FP>Enduring separation and relocation, heartache and anticipation, military spouses demonstrate a strength reflective of the spirit of our Nation. The spouses of our men and women in uniform bear the burden of sustaining their families, caring for children and offering comfort and support while their loved ones are away. As a country, we must keep faith with military spouses and uphold our commitment to the members of our Armed Forces to look after their families.</FP>
  <FP>Five years ago, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden launched the Joining Forces initiative. Through Joining Forces, my Administration is working to ensure the spouses of our men and women in uniform have good, secure jobs so they can better provide for their families. We launched the Military Spouse Employment Partnership—uniting hundreds of businesses across America in a collaborative effort to employ more military spouses. Additionally, I proposed an increase in funding to help address the barriers that too often hold back transitioning service members and their spouses from greater economic possibility. And I have taken action to improve access to mental health care for our veterans and their families, and to ensure they are able to find adequate housing—because anyone who defended America should have a home in America. I encourage all people to visit www.JoiningForces.gov to learn how to get involved or for more information.</FP>
  <FP>Military spouses exhibit tremendous courage and unyielding faith, and in their spirit of resolve, we see the best of America. Let us celebrate these selfless individuals by supporting them and upholding our everlasting commitment to stand beside them and their families.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2016, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Throughout our history, women have contributed to shaping the course of our country—and with each generation, they have helped affirm the timeless belief that everyone deserves an equal shot at reaching for our Nation's promise. We have achieved great progress in tearing down barriers that deny women equal opportunities, but we still have more to do to ensure <PRTPAGE P="101"/>that health care is a right for every American, regardless of sex or gender. This week, we recommit to ensuring equal access to high-quality care for women and to building a more prosperous, healthy future.</FP>
  <FP>Ensuring women can live full and healthy lives is vital, and central to that mission is improving the quality, affordability, and accessibility of health care for women. Because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurance companies can no longer charge women more than men or use preexisting conditions—including pregnancy—to deny them the care they need.</FP>
  <FP>Twenty million Americans have gained health insurance since the passage of the ACA, including roughly 9.5 million women since the first open enrollment period in 2013. Under the Act, annual limits on out-of-pocket spending for essential health benefits have been established, and lifetime and annual limits on insurance coverage have been eliminated. For 55 million women, critical preventive services, including well-woman visits, certain cancer screenings, and domestic violence screenings and counseling sessions, are now guaranteed with no out-of-pocket costs. Access to preventive care can help identify and diagnose conditions early, benefiting countless women across our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>The important decisions that affect a woman's health should be left to her alone. Today, efforts around our country to weaken access to contraception and to limit a woman's right to choose threaten to reverse decades of hard-won progress. It is crucial we reject actions that obstruct women's access to sexual and reproductive health services and stand firm in protecting their access to safe, affordable health care and the constitutional right to privacy, including the right to reproductive freedom.</FP>
  <FP>National Women's Health Week is an opportunity to refocus our commitment to advancing women's health and ensuring a healthy future for all our Nation's women and girls. To learn more about women's health, and for health care options available for women and girls, visit www.WomensHealth.gov or www.GirlsHealth.gov.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8 through May 14, 2016, as National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the progress we have made in protecting women's health and to promote awareness, preventive care, and educational activities that improve the health of all women.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On Mother's Day, we celebrate those who are the first to welcome us into the world. Performing the most important work there is, mothers—biological, foster, or adoptive—are our first role models and earliest motivators. They balance enormous responsibilities and shape who we become as adults, their lessons guiding us throughout life. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status, mothers have always moved our Nation forward and remained steadfast in their pursuit of a better and brighter future for their children.</FP>
  <FP>Caring and loving without condition, even in our darkest moments, mothers put the interests of their kids ahead of their own. They are inspiring embodiments of strength and determined drivers of progress, and through their example, our youth learn the values of grace, empathy, and kindness. For generations, mothers have led the charge toward a freer, more inclusive country—embracing the task of ensuring our Nation upholds its highest ideals so that they, and America's daughters, know the same opportunities as America's fathers and sons.</FP>
  <FP>Our country's mothers deserve our unwavering support—at home, in the workplace, and throughout our communities. I am committed to empowering working mothers so they do not have to choose between caring for their family and earning their paycheck, and I will continue fighting to ensure those who choose to become mothers are not financially punished for doing so. My Administration has pushed to expand child care and strengthen paid leave, including maternity leave. We will also keep working to close the gender pay gap—a disparity that is contrary to our values as Americans, limits the scope of mothers' futures, and affects those they provide for. And earlier this year, we launched an effort to help low-income mothers and families afford diapers—a basic necessity for babies—by bringing together online retailers, diaper manufacturers, and nonprofits to reduce the high cost of diapers.</FP>
  <FP>Each of us is the son or daughter of a mother. Today, let us pay these extraordinary women the admiration and respect they deserve. And each day, let us thank them for all they have done for us, remember those whose spirits remain with us, and support those who take on the awesome mantle of motherhood.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as “Mother's Day” and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2016, as Mother's Day. I urge all Americans to express love and gratitude to mothers everywhere, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.<PRTPAGE P="103"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every day across our Nation, women and men sacrifice precious time with their loved ones, working long and hard to provide emergency medical services (EMS) to people they have never met before. Often operating in the midst of trauma and heartbreak, these professionals deliver urgent and essential care, saving lives and upholding a timeless belief that defines who we are as Americans—that we all must look out for one another. This week, we recognize the daily heroism of our EMS professionals at all levels, and we express our gratitude for their efforts to keep us healthy and safe.</FP>
  <FP>Embodying the grit, compassion, and courage that has driven our Nation forward since its founding, our emergency medical technicians, paramedics, 911 dispatchers, nurses, physicians, EMS medical directors, firefighters, and law enforcement officers reflect a spirit of selflessness that makes us all strive to live up to their example. Their families stand beside them, enduring extraordinary anticipation and exercising sincere patience each day. As the steady anchors in an otherwise unpredictable daily routine, these families offer unwavering support for EMS practitioners—giving them the support and strength necessary to fulfill the demands of their unending work.</FP>
  <FP>EMS providers brave danger and uncertainty, and their efforts deserve our most profound appreciation. We rarely know when tragedy will strike, and in our most vulnerable moments, we rely on these dedicated professionals. During Emergency Medical Services Week, let us celebrate and support the EMS professionals who demonstrate the values at the heart of the American spirit, and let us thank them for their heroic work.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2016, as Emergency Medical Services Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>At the core of our national character is our persistent belief in what we, as a people, can accomplish as one. Connecting every corner of our country and each chapter of our Nation's story, our infrastructure has always played a critical role in helping us solve our shared challenges and in fueling the innovation and productivity that drive our economy. On National Defense Transportation Day and during National Transportation Week, we reflect on the importance of infrastructure throughout our history, and we recognize the need to invest in these essential pathways to our future.</FP>
  <FP>From the National Road envisioned by our Founders to the Interstate Highway System first authorized six decades ago, the history of infrastructure projects in our country reflects the belief that the progress made by each generation is built on the efforts of those who came before. Our investments in transportation systems have not only driven extraordinary and innovative advances, but they have also uplifted our Nation in times of great trial. Authorizing the construction of hundreds of thousands of miles of roads, the Works Progress Administration—established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt—played a major role in lifting our Nation from the depths of the Great Depression. And America would not be what it is today without structures like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Hoover Dam—defining symbols of the daring ingenuity brought about by the grit and unwavering determination of our people.</FP>
  <FP>In our time, it is imperative that we carry forward this legacy by rebuilding our roads, transit lines, bridges, ports, and water systems. That is why my Administration has worked to repair and modernize our transportation infrastructure; connected more individuals, businesses, and communities across our country to high-speed broadband; and called on the Congress to commit to making the long-term investments in our infrastructure on which our country depends. And because there is no greater threat to our planet and to future generations than the peril of a changing climate, I have put forward a plan for creating a 21st Century Clean Transportation System to put us on a course to develop secure, resilient infrastructure that can reduce carbon pollution while strengthening our economy.</FP>
  <FP>Our transportation systems represent important parts of our history and heritage, but they are also critical to our safety and security, and ensuring they are stable and sound for future generations is vital. Our first responders travel our roads to confront danger and save lives; aid workers travel far and wide to bring relief in the wake of tragedy and devastation; and our Armed Forces utilize transportation networks each day to protect our Nation and our values.</FP>

  <FP>This year, we mark 50 years since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Department of Transportation Act. Embodying both optimism for the future and a clear understanding of the work needed to shape that future, the founding of the Department of Transportation reminds us that America's <PRTPAGE P="105"/>progress has never been inevitable, that it has always depended on our people deciding, with boldness and vision, to renew our country's promise. In that spirit, let us reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling this tremendous task in the face of the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow.</FP>
  <FP>In recognition of the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and of the men and women who build, operate, maintain, and utilize it, the Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as “National Defense Transportation Day,” and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as “National Transportation Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 2016, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain it.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Each May, Americans set aside a week to raise awareness of the threat posed by hurricanes—storms that can devastate communities, neighborhoods, and local economies. The high winds, heavy rains, lightning, and tornadoes that can come with these powerful storms cause serious damage, but with proper preparation we can ensure the safety of ourselves and our loved ones. During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we take deliberate action to safeguard our communities and work together to improve our resilience to hurricanes.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation is better prepared than ever before for today's storms. Our technology, forecasting, and models have improved, and we have new ways of disseminating vital warnings and storm-tracking information. Still, it is never too early to prepare for a potential disaster. I urge all Americans to visit www.Ready.gov and www.Hurricanes.gov/prepare to find key information on building an emergency supply kit and knowing what to do when disaster strikes. By having a plan ready, with ideas about how to respond to warnings, you can help avoid tragedy befalling you and your loved ones. Our communities are not resilient unless individuals have taken proper precautions.<PRTPAGE P="106"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Hurricane intensity and rainfall are projected to increase as a result of climate change. My Administration is dedicated to ensuring our resilience in response to these climate change-related impacts. We are working with the Congress, the private sector, and communities across America to build climate-resilient infrastructure, and we are cutting red tape to help those in need of recovery assistance better navigate the environmental reviews necessary to ensure a rapid and resilient recovery. The Federal Government is coordinating with State and local governments to ensure their climate action plans are up to date and to mitigate the worst effects of hurricanes—including through making buildings more resilient, home elevations, and improving drainage—so people are in a better position to avoid loss, damage, and interruption of critical services, and so our communities are in a better position to recover from storms. As a country, we continue to make strides in achieving the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across communities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.</FP>
  <FP>This past summer, our Nation commemorated the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina—a tragedy that claimed the lives of more than 1,800 of our fellow Americans. We all have a responsibility to step up and take action to protect our Nation from such devastating disasters. As we enter hurricane season, let us renew our commitment to that responsibility, and let us unite in common purpose to safeguard our communities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in the areas of our Nation vulnerable to hurricanes to share information about preparedness and response to help save lives and protect their communities.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>For generations, the brave women and men of our Nation's law enforcement have answered the call to serve and protect our communities. Enduring long shifts in dangerous and unpredictable circumstances, our Nation's peace officers embody the courage and honor that represent the best of America. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for the selfless public servants who wear the badge and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and we pay respect for those who lost their lives in the line of duty.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>In moments of danger and desperation, the first people we turn to are law enforcement officers. These often unsung heroes risk their lives and sacrifice precious time with loved ones so their fellow Americans can live in peace and security. But more than that, they are leaders in their communities, serving as mentors, coaches, friends, and neighbors—working tirelessly each day to ensure that the people they serve have the opportunities that should be afforded to all Americans. In honor of all they do, we must give these dedicated professionals the support and appreciation they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration continues to work to ensure police departments and other law enforcement agencies throughout our country have the resources required to hire, train, and retain officers, provide officers with modern and necessary equipment, and utilize technology to enhance their communication networks. And our Federal law enforcement officers regularly partner with their State and local counterparts to address some of our Nation's most difficult problems. We know that strong community bonds are essential for law enforcement to do their jobs effectively. I established a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, bringing together law enforcement, academia, youth, civil rights, and community leaders to provide concrete recommendations to enhance public safety while building community trust. Law enforcement officials care deeply about their communities, and together with our partners in law enforcement, we must work to build up our neighborhoods, prevent crime before it happens, and put opportunity within reach for all our people.</FP>
  <FP>Because each fallen peace officer is one too many, I proudly signed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act last year—bipartisan legislation that establishes a national “Blue Alert” communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers. The legislation seeks to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer's safety. I also announced new, commonsense gun safety reforms to help keep guns out of the wrong hands and emphasized that the already dangerous job of an officer is far more dangerous than it should be because it remains too easy for criminals and people who are a danger to others or themselves to have access to guns.</FP>
  <FP>It takes a special kind of courage to be a peace officer. Whether deputies or detectives, tribal police or forest service officers, beat cops or Federal agents, we hold up those who wear the badge as heroes. Though they too often spend their days witnessing America at its worst, in their extraordinary examples, we see America at its best. On this day and throughout this week, let us celebrate those who nobly serve each day—and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice—to move our world toward a more just and safe tomorrow. May we carry forward their brave and selfless spirit as we keep working together to shape a future worthy of their commitment.</FP>
  <FP>By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as “Peace Officers Memorial Day” and the week in which it falls as “Police Week.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2016, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as Police Week. I call upon all <PRTPAGE P="108"/>Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The United States of America cannot afford to sit on the sidelines of the global economy. With over 95 percent of our Nation's potential customers living outside our borders, trade agreements are a vital part of our agenda for creating jobs and growing our economy—and smart trade agreements that level the playing field for American workers and businesses are a vital piece of middle-class economics. During World Trade Week, we reaffirm the importance of global trade, and we redouble our efforts to pursue trade deals that reflect American values and give our people a fair shot at success.</FP>
  <FP>America's small businesses employ more than half of all Americans, and they represent 98 percent of our Nation's exporters. I am committed to a trade agenda that includes strong, enforceable provisions in our agreements that help our businesses—large and small—support higher-paying jobs and ship products stamped “Made in the USA” around the world. My Administration has ramped up enforcement of our trade laws like never before. Last year, I renewed and expanded the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, providing job training and other assistance to American workers. And earlier this year, I signed bipartisan legislation that helps us enforce our trade agreements—helping ensure that other countries play by the rules.</FP>

  <FP>Some of our greatest economic opportunities abroad are in the Asia-Pacific region. For more than 5 years, the United States negotiated a new, forward-looking trade deal that puts workers first and ensures we write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st century. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) brings 12 countries representing nearly 40 percent of the global economy together to trade and invest in the Asia-Pacific—one of the world's fastest growing regions. The TPP includes fully enforceable provisions that ensure a free and open Internet, respect intellectual property rights, protect the environment, and uphold worker rights. It eliminates more than 18,000 taxes imposed by other countries on American products, and it bolsters our leadership abroad while supporting good jobs here at home. The United States signed TPP this year, and I will continue working with the Congress to enact it as soon as possible.<PRTPAGE P="109"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The largest trade and investment relationship in the world is between the United States and the European Union—yet too many barriers remain in the way of even greater trade and investment between us. That is why, together, we have moved forward with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), which will eliminate tariffs, simplify procedures, bridge differences in regulations, and cut red tape. T-TIP also enforces strong standards, and it will reinforce our larger trans-Atlantic relationship—the foundation of our prosperity and security since World War II.</FP>
  <FP>Our global economy's growth is fueled by trade. While understandable skepticism exists about trade, particularly in places that have been hit hard by trade deals of the past, we cannot ignore the realities of the new economy. Rather, we must set the highest standards for our trade agreements, enforce the commitments and obligations of our trading partners, and help write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st-century global economy, as we have done with TPP and will do through T-TIP. And we must continue to harness the dynamism and entrepreneurship inherent to who we are as a people and enable Americans to sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world. This week, let us renew our commitment to that mission and work together toward a future of greater opportunity for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2016, as World Trade Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hepatitis Testing Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>In the United States, hepatitis A, B, and C are the most common types of viral hepatitis—affecting between 3.5 and 6.9 million people and claiming the lives of thousands of our fellow Americans each year. Because of the persistent efforts of researchers, advocates, and so many others in the medical and public health communities, we have made great strides in advancing treatment of and finding cures for viral hepatitis. Individuals living with hepatitis B and C can only benefit from these advances if they are tested and made aware of their disease. On National Hepatitis Testing Day, we reaffirm the importance of educating people about viral hepatitis, and we encourage individuals at risk for hepatitis B and hepatitis C to get tested.<PRTPAGE P="110"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>More than half of Americans living with viral hepatitis are unaware of their infection status. This lack of awareness contributes to an increasing number of infections and deaths that could be prevented by people receiving the care and treatment they need. When left undiagnosed and untreated, viral hepatitis can cause serious damage to the liver—it is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation. Symptoms of viral hepatitis can go undetected for many years, which is why it is important to receive vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and blood tests for hepatitis B and C—measures that can be life-saving for those living with this disease. I urge all Americans to visit www.CDC.gov/Hepatitis for more information.</FP>
  <FP>Prevention and early detection are key to combating viral hepatitis, and my Administration remains dedicated to ensuring all Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve. The Affordable Care Act requires coverage of recommended services that can help prevent, detect, and treat viral hepatitis—including viral hepatitis vaccinations and testing. In addition, the Act prohibits insurers from denying coverage to anyone with a preexisting condition, like viral hepatitis. We have also released a roadmap for ensuring our Federal efforts to address viral hepatitis are coordinated and focused on making more people living with viral hepatitis aware of their status. The Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, available at www.HHS.gov/Hepatitis, spans more than 20 Federal entities and it moves us toward increasing the number of people who are aware of their infection status, reducing the number of new cases of hepatitis C, and eliminating the transmission of hepatitis B between mother and child.</FP>
  <FP>I have proposed funding to support a new initiative aimed at expanding testing and access to treatment of hepatitis C for people living with HIV and to advance efforts to eliminate hepatitis C transmission and deaths. Those living with HIV are more vulnerable to viral hepatitis infections, and African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians and Alaska Natives are also disproportionately affected. Viral hepatitis infections, particularly among young people, can be reduced by addressing the heroin epidemic and abuse of prescription opioids—a priority for my Administration—and by ensuring that individuals who inject drugs have access to treatment services for HIV, viral hepatitis, and substance use disorders. We have taken action to expand access to treatment and increase community prevention strategies so more Americans can get the help they need.</FP>
  <FP>On this day, let us rededicate ourselves to ensuring all people with viral hepatitis know their infection status and have access to necessary care and resources. Let us honor those we have lost too soon, and let us recognize the many individuals working tirelessly to address this disease, develop treatments, and save lives.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19, 2016, as National Hepatitis Testing Day.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Each year, as summer approaches and warmer weather draws crowds to our Nation's beaches, lakes, and rivers, we set aside a week to recognize the importance of taking boating safety precautions before taking to the water. Throughout National Safe Boating Week, we recognize the risks associated with one of our country's favorite pastimes and encourage everyone to apply safe boating practices.</FP>
  <FP>Safe boating practices should be observed prior to leaving land—no matter the length of the trip, the type of boat, or the size of the body of water. Boaters can reduce risks and enhance their safety by enrolling in a boating safety course. Vessels should be thoroughly examined, float plans should be prepared, and current laws and regulations should be known prior to embarking on a journey on the water. I encourage everyone to visit www.USCGBoating.org to find resources, learn more about responsible boating, or apply for a free vessel safety check. When boat operators and their passengers exercise caution when boating—including by wearing life jackets at all times and avoiding consumption of drugs and alcohol—accidents can be avoided, lives can be saved, and everyone can have a safe and enjoyable experience.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we also recognize the men and women of the United States Coast Guard who dedicate themselves to protecting our Nation's waterways and assisting those at sea. As we continue to take advantage of our country's beautiful bodies of water, let us recommit to ensuring water safety and exercising appropriate boating procedures.</FP>
  <FP>In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as “National Safe Boating Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2016, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and taking advantage of boating education.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Armed Forces Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who comprise our Armed Forces have defended our Nation and the values for which we stand for generations, answering the call to give up the comforts of civilian life, do whatever it takes to keep us safe, and go wherever they are needed. On Armed Forces Day, we offer our most profound gratitude to the patriots—at home and abroad—who have risked their lives so our people can live knowing the fullest measure of freedom and security.</FP>
  <FP>With courage and honor, our men and women in uniform embody the everlasting responsibility we have to each other and to future generations by giving of themselves to ensure the preservation of our Republic and secure peace throughout the world. It is because of them and the values they represent that people across the globe look to the United States of America in moments of desperation and despair. For the relief they offer, the stability they provide, and the hope they inspire, we owe our service members an extraordinary debt—one we will never stop working to repay.</FP>
  <FP>Our country's strength is measured by how we support and take care of our troops. Humbled by the sacrifices they make—and by the strength of their families—we stand in support of those who don our uniform and strive to ensure they have every opportunity to pursue the American dream they defend. They give their best for America, and they deserve the best from us. On this day, let us salute these brave Americans and all those who laid down their lives for our safety, and each day, let us remember that we live knowing liberty because of our Armed Forces.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</FP>
  <FP>I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for encouraging the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.</FP>
  <FP>I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day.</FP>

  <FP>Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at organizations that provide support to our troops and their families.<PRTPAGE P="113"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since America's founding, proud mariners have selflessly dedicated themselves to protecting and advancing our interests—here at home and around the world. The patriots of the United States Merchant Marine have long served as our Nation's “fourth arm of defense,” safeguarding the ideals that have guided our country for more than two centuries. They facilitate the transport and trade of American goods, and they put their lives on the line in times of war. On National Maritime Day, we honor our Merchant Mariners and celebrate their irreplaceable role in shaping our Nation's narrative.</FP>
  <FP>Whether in still or raging waters, Merchant Mariners are fundamental to guaranteeing the delivery of essential goods to far-reaching corners of our globe. These seafarers have bravely faced threats at home and abroad—including combatants and pirates, disease outbreaks and natural disasters—and they consistently heed the call to serve their fellow Americans. In World War II, their ships carried troops and much-needed support to the battlefield, thousands making the ultimate sacrifice. They were among the first to see battle, and many were among the last to return home to our shores.</FP>
  <FP>Carrying forward a legacy that spans generations, the United States Merchant Marine is vital to our Nation's economic security as well. Their transportation of vital cargo has impacts far beyond America's borders, generating trillions of dollars of economic activity each year. And when our entrepreneurs decide to embark on new ventures across oceans, mariners stand by and protect their pursuit of the American dream through tireless work to cultivate safe and open waterways. On this day, and every day, let us express our sincere gratitude to these courageous men and women for all they do for our Nation, and let us reaffirm our commitment to support them as they continue to uphold their proud tradition of service.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as “National Maritime Day,” and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2016, as National Maritime Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to <PRTPAGE P="114"/>display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on this day.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>With courage and a love of country that knows no limits, America's men and women in uniform exemplify patriotism at its core—stepping into harm's way to protect our people and to safeguard the ideals that have long sustained our democracy. Those who serve under the stars and stripes embody the highest form of citizenship, and on Memorial Day, we pay solemn tribute to those brave Americans who laid down their lives to defend our freedom.</FP>
  <FP>Since America's earliest days, proud patriots have forged a safer, more secure Nation, and though battlefields have changed and technology has evolved, the selflessness of our service members has remained steadfast. They have stepped forward when our country was locked in revolution and civil war; fought threats of fascism and terrorism; and led the way in securing peace and stability around the globe. They have sacrificed more than most of us could ever imagine—not for glory or gratitude, but for causes greater than themselves. In the children who replicate their courage and strength, in the spouses and partners who forever seek to mend their broken hearts, and in the parents who mourn the absence of the sons and daughters they raised, we are reminded of our enduring commitment to do right by our fallen warriors and their families.</FP>
  <FP>Those who gave their last full measure of devotion for the values that bind us as one people deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. In recognizing those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we pledge to never stop working to fulfill our obligations to all members of our Armed Forces so they know we stand beside them every step of the way—not just when we need them, but also when they need us.</FP>
  <FP>Today, and every day, let us remember the servicemen and women we have lost, and let us honor them by rededicating ourselves to strengthening our Nation's promise. With love, grace, and reflection, let us honor our fallen fellow Americans, known and unknown, who sacrificed their freedom to ensure our own.</FP>

  <FP>In honor of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent <PRTPAGE P="115"/>peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2016, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time during which people may unite in prayer.</FP>
  <FP>I also ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>A vital part of our Nation's proud heritage, African-American music exemplifies the creative spirit at the heart of American identity and is among the most innovative and powerful art the world has ever known. It accompanies us in our daily lives, and it has rung out at turning points in our history and demonstrated how our achievements as a culture go hand-in-hand with our progress as a Nation. During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we honor the artists who, through this music, bring us together, show us a true reflection of ourselves, and inspire us to reach for the harmony that lies beyond our toughest struggles.</FP>
  <FP>Songs by African-American musicians span the breadth of the human experience and resonate in every corner of our Nation—animating our bodies, stimulating our imaginations, and nourishing our souls. In the ways they transform real stories about real people into art, these artists speak to universal human emotion and the restlessness that stirs within us all. African-American music helps us imagine a better world, and it offers hope that we will get there together.</FP>

  <FP>This month, we celebrate the music that reminds us that our growth as a Nation and as people is reflected in our capacity to create great works of art. Let us recognize the performers behind this incredible music, which has compelled us to stand up—to dance, to express our faith through song, <PRTPAGE P="116"/>to march against injustice, and to defend our country's enduring promise of freedom and opportunity for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as African-American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and foster appreciation of music that is composed, arranged, or performed by African Americans.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Great Outdoors Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every day, Americans draw inspiration from the landscapes and outdoor spaces that surround us and connect us with our heritage and with one another. People have lived off of these lands and waters throughout history, and today, they continue to enrich our national experience. In June, we celebrate America's natural and cultural treasures and rich bounty of resources, and we recommit to upholding our responsibility, as those who came before us did, to ensure they are sustained for those who will inherit them.</FP>
  <FP>From dense forests and vast deserts to lakes and rivers teeming with wildlife, our National Parks and other public spaces belong to all of us. That is why I have sought to protect places that are culturally and historically significant and that reflect the story of all our people. My Administration has also worked hard to ensure that everyone has the chance to easily visit and enjoy these spectacular areas. All Americans can explore the parks and monuments we share as our birthright, including through the “Find Your Park” campaign, which my Administration established to help connect people from all walks of life with new outdoor destinations and experiences. We also established the “Every Kid in a Park” initiative, offering free access to our National Parks and other public lands and waters for an entire year to fourth grade students and their families. And by increasing funding for the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps, we are striving to give more Americans hands-on opportunities to restore, enhance, and give back to the outdoor spaces that have given us so much.</FP>

  <FP>Our experiences in nature remind us how fragile our ecosystems can be and of our obligation to protect them. That is why I am proud to have set aside more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters—more than any President in our history—and why my Administration has taken unprecedented action to tackle climate change. The planet and its natural <PRTPAGE P="117"/>beauty are changing as rising temperatures fuel the melting of glaciers and the increasing intensity of extreme weather events, including longer wildfire seasons and deeper droughts, and as seas rise, coastal communities face greater threats from flooding and eroding shorelines. It is within our power to address the peril of climate change, and we must act before it is too late.</FP>
  <FP>During Great Outdoors Month, let us enjoy our Nation's natural bounty, whether in reflective solitude or in the energizing company of friends and family. As we rediscover the beauty of the outdoors—in our own backyards, along distant trails, or in the shadows of towering mountains—let us rededicate ourselves to preserving nature's splendor for future generations.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Great Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors and to uphold our Nation's legacy of conserving our lands and waters.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our founding, America has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect Union. This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth. The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society. They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment—under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics. This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice.</FP>
  <FP>Last year's landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines. For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals.</FP>

  <FP>LGBT individuals deserve to know their country stands beside them. That is why my Administration is striving to better understand the needs of LGBT adults and to provide affordable, welcoming, and supportive housing to aging LGBT Americans. It is also why we oppose subjecting minors to <PRTPAGE P="118"/>the harmful practice of conversion therapy, and why we are continuing to promote equality and foster safe and supportive learning environments for all students. We remain committed to addressing health disparities in the LGBT community—gay and bisexual men and transgender women of color are at a particularly high risk for HIV, and we have worked to strengthen our National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce new infections, increase access to care, and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV.</FP>
  <FP>Despite the extraordinary progress of the past few years, LGBT Americans still face discrimination simply for being who they are. I signed an Executive Order in 2014 that prohibits discrimination against Federal employees and contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. I urge the Congress to enact legislation that builds upon the progress we have made, because no one should live in fear of losing their job simply because of who they are or who they love. And our commitment to combatting discrimination against the LGBT community does not stop at our borders: Advancing the fair treatment of all people has long been a cornerstone of American diplomacy, and we have made defending and promoting the human rights of LGBT individuals a priority in our engagement across the globe. In line with America's commitment to the notion that all people should be treated fairly and with respect, champions of this cause at home and abroad are upholding the simple truth that LGBT rights are human rights.</FP>
  <FP>There remains much work to do to extend the promise of our country to every American, but because of the acts of courage of the millions who came out and spoke out to demand justice and of those who quietly toiled and pushed for progress, our Nation has made great strides in recognizing what these brave individuals long knew to be true in their hearts—that love is love and that no person should be judged by anything but the content of their character. During Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, as Americans wave their flags of pride high and march boldly forward in parades and demonstrations, let us celebrate how far we have come and reaffirm our steadfast belief in the equal dignity of all Americans.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The dynamism and diversity of Caribbean Americans have contributed to our Nation's story in extraordinary ways. Millions of people in the United States are connected to our Caribbean neighbors through ties of commerce and family—a relationship reinforced by the values and history we hold in common. During National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the contributions of our Caribbean-American brothers and sisters, and we reflect on how they have bolstered our country and enriched our traditions.</FP>
  <FP>The bonds between the United States and the Caribbean remain strong. Both rooted in similar legacies—of trial and triumph, oppression and liberation—our narratives have advanced on a similar path of progress, driven forward by our shared dedication to fostering opportunity and forging a brighter future. Caribbean Americans excel in our universities, inspire us as athletes and musicians, guide us as community and government leaders, and keep us safe through dedicated service in our Armed Forces.</FP>
  <FP>The United States is committed to working with the nations of the Caribbean to advance security, liberty, and prosperity. That is why we have begun a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba—extending a new hand of friendship to the Cuban people that offers fresh hope for both our futures and will improve the lives of those living in both our countries. My Administration also introduced the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to provide higher education exchanges to students across the Western Hemisphere, and we launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps in the Americas and to give emerging entrepreneurs and civil society leaders the resources they need to reach their full potential. In harnessing the spirit and boldness of young people in the Caribbean and throughout the Americas, and in channeling their creativity and innovation, we can continue to build on the progress we have made. And by carrying out Jamaican-American poet Claude McKay's call to “strive on to gain the height although it may not be in sight,” we can enable more young people, here at home and throughout the Caribbean, to reach for the change that is within their grasp.</FP>
  <FP>The legacy of Caribbean Americans is one of tenacity and drive; it reminds us that in America, with faith and determination, anything is possible. This month, let us honor the resilient heritage and rich history of Caribbean Americans, and let us reflect upon the diversity of experiences that unites us as a people.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Covering more than 70 percent of the earth's surface, oceans have a profound impact on our way of life. Home to a great diversity of plant and animal species, their precious ecosystems provide food and energy that are integral to our survival. In bringing tourism and recreation to coastal areas, oceans are important to America's economy, and they help facilitate trade and transportation, give mobility to our Armed Forces, and preserve our Nation's maritime heritage. In observation of National Oceans Month, we recommit to good ocean stewardship and redouble our efforts to preserve the health and resilience of our vast oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.</FP>
  <FP>Jeopardizing marine populations and degrading oceanic habitats, pollution poses a significant risk to all of our interconnected oceans. Oceans and their nearby regions are also highly vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate—a once-distant threat that is now very present and is affecting ecosystems and shoreline communities on every coast. Rising sea levels, coastal storms, and a growing risk of erosion and flooding are looming realities faced by seaside towns. It is critical that we take measures to safeguard our blue planet and heed the urgency to defend against these mounting threats, particularly in the Arctic where the effects of a changing climate are already swiftly accelerating.</FP>
  <FP>In collaboration with stakeholders; scientists; businesses; and State, tribal, and local partners, my Administration is continuing to implement the National Ocean Policy, a coordinated effort to support local communities, strengthen our ocean economy, and improve the health of our oceans. We are concentrating on key areas outlined in our 2016 Annual Work Plan, including combatting illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing and monitoring significant changes in the acidity of our oceans. We are also focused on reducing the toxic effects of harmful algal blooms, which occur when algae grow too rapidly and threaten the safety of our food, drinking water, and air quality. Using the science-based roadmap laid out in the National Ocean Policy, we are dedicated to enhancing the economic and ecological sustainability of our oceans and advancing our knowledge of how they influence and are influenced by human activity.</FP>

  <FP>This month, let us continue the work of ensuring the well-being of these grand bodies of water and the communities that depend on them.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Two hundred and forty years ago, a small band of patriots declared independence, proclaiming in one voice that we are free to determine our own destiny and carry out the work of self-governance. Driven by their unyielding spirit and drawing inspiration from the Stars and Stripes, a string of 13 Colonies later expanded to become a united 50 States. Throughout our history, the American flag has steadfastly served as an emblem of this great experiment in democracy. On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we pledge our allegiance to the banner that has served as a guiding symbol on our Nation's journey, and we celebrate the hope it inspires in the American people.</FP>
  <FP>With hands over hearts, Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs have long saluted Old Glory and honored its legacy. Our flag persists as a powerful representation of freedom and opportunity. Waving high above capitol buildings and courthouses, military bases and embassies across the globe, and on the distant surface of the moon, it calls on each of us to remember our obligations to the Republic for which it stands and to carry forward the unwavering optimism that defines us. America endures because of the courage of servicemen and women who serve under this standard, and our veterans are forever draped in the red, white, and blue when they are laid to rest. Wherever the flag lies or flies, its message is clear: We rise and fall together, as one Nation and one people.</FP>
  <FP>The American flag invokes pride in our citizens and hope in those who come to our shores in search of a brighter tomorrow. In recognition of the ways it has embodied our ideals and sustained our Nation, let us pay tribute to the Star Spangled Banner and continue striving to create a more perfect and indivisible Union—with liberty and justice for all.</FP>

  <FP>To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as “Flag Day” and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. <PRTPAGE P="122"/>194), that the President annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as “National Flag Week” and call upon citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2016, as Flag Day and the week beginning June 12, 2016, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Too often, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation threaten the livelihoods of older individuals and erode their extraordinary potential. One in ten seniors in America experiences mistreatment or abuse—including domestic and sexual violence—and because these incidents are vastly underreported, only a limited number of victims are able to get the help they need. Today, we join our international partners in renewing our commitment to combat and raise awareness of elder abuse, and in striving to ensure security and dignity for all seniors.</FP>
  <FP>Worldwide, millions of people—predominantly women—experience different forms of elder abuse, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Theft, fraud, and other types of financial exploitation also affect seniors across socioeconomic lines, and neglect and abandonment can cause great harm to vulnerable older individuals. My Administration is dedicated to addressing this serious problem by providing care to survivors of abuse, transforming our Nation's criminal justice systems to better understand elder abuse as a criminal issue, and increasing public awareness of warning signs and prevention strategies. Additionally, because the majority of elder abuse victims are women, we are working to support women domestically and abroad and to combat gender-based violence around the world.</FP>
  <FP>One of the best measures of a country is how it treats its older citizens. My Administration is devoted to strengthening Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act, and Social Security. Together, these programs have significantly reduced the rate of seniors living in poverty, helped older Americans access health care and quality care services, and allowed older Americans to remain independent as they age. The Elder Justice Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, took new steps to address elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation and established an Elder Justice Coordinating Council through which Federal agencies are working together to address elder abuse and neglect. And our commitment to supporting survivors of all ages is reflected in the Violence Against Women Act, which dedicates Federal funds to victim service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors working to respond to domestic and sexual violence experienced by older adults.</FP>

  <FP>Last year, I was proud to host the White House Conference on Aging to identify ways we can improve the quality of life for older Americans and enable them to live in retirement with dignity. Held once a decade, this conference brought together older Americans, their families, caregivers, and advocates to focus on key issue areas, including the importance of elder justice. In addition to taking new steps to expand protections against financial exploitation, assist victims of crimes, and review the science of understanding and preventing abuse through better screening tools, we have built on many of the Federal efforts already underway and are working to support aging Americans for decades to come.<PRTPAGE P="124"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, let us resolve to give all people the tools and support they need to live out their golden years in peace and security. Let us fight cruelty against seniors wherever it exists, and together, let us stamp out all forms of elder abuse—here at home and across the globe.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2016, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by learning the signs of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and by raising awareness about this important public health issue.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Week of Making, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The same American spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship that has steered our Nation through the industrial and digital revolutions—and led our people to explore the depths of the oceans and the distant planets in our solar system—has enabled us to reimagine our world through new ideas and discoveries. Since our earliest days, makers, artists, and inventors have driven our economy and transformed how we live by taking risks, collaborating, and drawing on their talents and imaginations to make our Nation more dynamic and interconnected. During National Week of Making, we recommit to sparking the creative confidence of all Americans and to giving them the skills, mentors, and resources they need to harness their passion and tackle some of our planet's greatest challenges.</FP>
  <FP>Today, Americans of all ages have the ability to connect and showcase their creativity through a growing maker movement. Technologies like 3D printing and desktop machine tools are rapidly lowering the costs of production; additional sources of capital such as crowdfunding are reducing barriers to getting started; and the democratization of technology is empowering more makers, helping to boost entrepreneurship and stimulate American manufacturing. Over the last 6 years, we have added over 800,000 manufacturing jobs and introduced next-generation manufacturing hubs. Just as the personal computer and the Internet transformed our Nation over the last several decades, these new opportunities can inspire the next generation of students, innovators, and entrepreneurs to carry forward our legacy of ingenuity.</FP>

  <FP>In 2014, I launched the Nation of Makers initiative to ensure more Americans of all ages and backgrounds have greater opportunities to design, build, and manufacture. My Administration is taking steps to foster “maker <PRTPAGE P="125"/>mindsets” by promoting skills like creative problem-solving, and to support the development of collaborative maker spaces so aspiring makers and manufacturers can turn their bold ideas into realities. I am proud that so many people across our country have already joined in this effort. Mayors have hosted maker roundtables and town halls; Federal agencies have worked with schools, libraries, recreation centers, and museums to create maker spaces, curricula, and tools to help students learn the design process; and private businesses and other local collaborators have empowered individuals with the entrepreneurial resources and skills they need to launch companies and sell their products.</FP>
  <FP>Together we must continue to expand opportunity for generations to come by working to eliminate the digital divide and reduce existing skill and confidence gaps. We must prepare young people for the jobs of the future by equipping them with the analytical skills needed to solve problems and the computer science and hardware development skills required to power our innovation economy. It is critical that we support the types of hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning experiences—in both formal and informal environments—that students encounter through making, which can help unlock their full potential and ignite their enthusiasm for the careers of tomorrow. That is why we are prioritizing investment in STEM teaching and active learning, expanding access to rigorous STEM courses like computer science, encouraging more opportunities in communities of greatest need, and working to get underrepresented students, including women and minorities, involved to increase diversity in STEM fields.</FP>
  <FP>Across our country, Americans are attending all types of maker events and workshops—from studios in small towns to the streets of our Nation's capital—to share their incredible inventions and ideas with others and to inspire all of us to join in the creative process. As we celebrate the power of American ingenuity, I invite communities to build on this progress by encouraging citizens to be creators and by working together to ensure that spaces for making are available anywhere Americans live, work, play, and learn. This week, let us turn today's sketches and dreams into tomorrow's “Made in America” labels, and let us embrace the audacious spirit of human curiosity that is embedded in our DNA.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 17 through June 23, 2016, as National Week of Making. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with programs, ceremonies, celebrations, and activities that encourage a new generation of makers and manufacturers to share their talents, solutions, and skills.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Father's Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Blessed with the extraordinary privilege and remarkable responsibility of fatherhood, dads play vital roles in our lives—inspiring us to reach for our highest potential, lifting us up when we need it most, and helping us become the people we were meant to be. Doing right by our families is the most important job any of us will ever have. On Father's Day, we thank the wonderful fathers—and stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, and mentors—in our lives, and we recognize the sacrifices they make to be there for us, through good times and bad.</FP>
  <FP>Fathers provide the discipline, guidance, and love it takes to flourish. With persistence and patience, generosity and integrity, they build our cores and help us understand right from wrong. They are some of our earliest and strongest sources of support and encouragement, and they serve as role models and sounding boards in our youth and as we grow. From single fathers who struggle to make ends meet to surrogates who step up to be there for America's daughters and sons, these men help shoulder the greatest obligation that exists—raising the next generation. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status; whether biological, foster, or adoptive; fathers teach their children the values that matter most and steer their moral compasses.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to enacting policies that make it easier for working fathers to support their families, including paid family leave. We must promote responsible fatherhood by lifting up the fathers who do their part to be the parents and providers their children need and by rejecting any excuse for failing to meet this obligation. Too many Americans grow up without a father figure in their lives, and it is imperative that America's responsible men step up to be mentors for our young people in need of guidance. To learn more, visit www.Fatherhood.gov or www.Mentor.gov.</FP>
  <FP>Being a father is about more than just having children—it is about summoning the courage to love and support them over anything else. We must always strive to be the best parents and role models we can be and commit to being present in the lives of our kids. Nothing is more precious than the moments we get to spend with our families—in conversations at the dinner table, coaching tips shouted from the sidelines, or profound experiences of learning and growing and teaching. Today, let us express our gratitude for the men who have enriched our lives and shaped our characters, and let us never stop working to show them how much they are valued and loved.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 19, 2016, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Stonewall National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Christopher Park, a historic community park located immediately across the street from the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City (City), is a place for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community to assemble for marches and parades, expressions of grief and anger, and celebrations of victory and joy. It played a key role in the events often referred to as the Stonewall Uprising or Rebellion, and has served as an important site for the LGBT community both before and after those events.</FP>
  <FP>As one of the only public open spaces serving Greenwich Village west of 6th Avenue, Christopher Park has long been central to the life of the neighborhood and to its identity as an LGBT-friendly community. The park was created after a large fire in 1835 devastated an overcrowded tenement on the site. Neighborhood residents persuaded the City to condemn the approximately 0.12-acre triangle for public open space in 1837. By the 1960s, Christopher Park had become a popular destination for LGBT youth, many of whom had run away from or been kicked out of their homes. These youth and others who had been similarly oppressed felt they had little to lose when the community clashed with the police during the Stonewall Uprising.</FP>
  <FP>In the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, a riot broke out in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, at the time one of the City's best known LGBT bars. Over the course of the next several days, more demonstrations and riots occurred in the surrounding neighborhood including Christopher Park. During these days, because of its strategic location across from the bar, Christopher Park served as a gathering place, refuge, and platform for the community to voice its demand for LGBT civil rights. The Stonewall Uprising is considered by many to be the catalyst that launched the modern LGBT civil rights movement. From this place and time, building on the work of many before, the Nation started the march—not yet finished—toward securing equality and respect for LGBT people.</FP>

  <FP>Christopher Park and its environs have remained a key gathering place for the LGBT community. For example, on June 26, 2015, within moments of the issuance of the Supreme Court's historic ruling in <E T="03">Obergefell</E> v. <E T="03">Hodges,</E> LGBT people headed to Christopher Park to celebrate the Court's recognition of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. A few days later, Governor Cuomo continued that celebration by officiating at the marriage of two gay men directly outside the Stonewall Inn. Within minutes of the recent news of the murders of 49 people in a nightclub in Orlando, Florida—<PRTPAGE P="128"/>one of the most deadly shootings in American history—LGBT people and their supporters in New York headed again to Christopher Park to mourn, heal, and stand together in unity for the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.</FP>
  <FP>Today, Christopher Park is surrounded by brick sidewalks and a nineteenth century wrought-iron fence with gated openings. Educational signs about the Stonewall Uprising are found near the large arched main entryway. Divided into two halves, the western side of the park is open to the public on a daily basis and contains a small plaza lined with brick pavers and benches. George Segal's sculpture, “Gay Liberation,” stands as a focal point of the plaza. The sculpture was commissioned in 1979 on the tenth anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, and its installation in 1992 cemented Christopher Park's role as a destination for those wishing to understand the significance of the Stonewall Uprising. The eastern half of the park contains two structures erected in 1936: a statue of Civil War General Philip Sheridan, and a memorial flagstaff and plaque honoring Colonel Ephraim Elmer Ellsworth, an officer with the New York Fire Zouaves during the Civil War.</FP>
  <FP>Across the street from Christopher Park is the target of the June 28, 1969, police raid, the Stonewall Inn (51-53 Christopher Street), originally built in 1843 and 1846 as two separate two-story horse stables. In 1930, the two buildings were combined into one commercial space with a new single exterior facade. In 1934, the first-floor space opened as a restaurant called Bonnie's Stonewall Inn, which served the neighborhood for over 30 years. The restaurant closed in 1966, but was reopened in 1967 as an LGBT bar called the Stonewall Inn.</FP>
  <FP>The streets and sidewalks in the neighborhood surrounding Christopher Park and the Stonewall Inn are an integral part of the neighborhood's historic character and played a significant role in the Stonewall Uprising. The narrow streets bend, wrap back on themselves, and otherwise create directional havoc. In the early 1800s, the residents rejected the City's attempts to enlarge the neighborhood streets and align them with the City's grid plan, and the extension of Seventh Avenue South through the area in the early 1900s only added confusion. During the Stonewall Uprising, this labyrinthine street pattern helped the LGBT demonstrators, who knew the neighborhood, to evade riot-control police, who were not from the local precinct.</FP>
  <FP>Viewed from Christopher Park's central location, this historic landscape—the park itself, the Stonewall Inn, the streets and sidewalks of the surrounding neighborhood—reveals the story of the Stonewall Uprising, a watershed moment for LGBT civil rights and a transformative event in the Nation's civil rights movement on par with the 1848 Women's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls and the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery March for voting rights in its role in energizing a broader community to demand equal rights.</FP>

  <FP>Although the 1960s were a time of social and political change that brought greater freedom to many segments of society, these new-found freedoms did not extend to members of the LGBT community. They faced increased oppression and criminal prosecution even for being physically intimate with consensual partners. In New York City, LGBT people were frequently arrested for acts such as same-sex dancing and kissing and wearing clothes <PRTPAGE P="129"/>of the perceived opposite gender. In some States, adults of the same sex caught having consensual sex in their own home could receive sentences of up to life in prison or be confined to a mental institution, where they faced horrific procedures, such as shock therapy, castration, and lobotomies. LGBT Americans lived their lives in secrecy for fear of losing their jobs, being evicted from their homes, or being arrested. For LGBT people of color or living in poverty, life was especially challenging.</FP>
  <FP>For over a century, Greenwich Village has attracted Americans of all kinds with an interest in political activism and nonconformity. By the 1930s, Greenwich Village was home to a significant LGBT community. Despite the aggressive anti-LGBT policies and practices that emerged in the City in the 1950s and 60s, a variety of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and private clubs catered to an LGBT clientele. Many establishments lasted only a few months before police raided them and shut them down, a practice that intensified during mayoral election years such as 1969.</FP>
  <FP>The police frequently raided LGBT bars for illegally selling alcoholic drinks to “homosexuals.” LGBT bars operated by organized crime syndicates often paid off members of the police force and in return received tips about when raids were planned. As part of a crackdown on LGBT bars in June 1969, the Public Morals squad of Manhattan's First Police Division raided the Stonewall Inn on June 24, 1969, confiscated its liquor, and arrested its employees. The Stonewall Inn reopened the next day. Having made only minimal impact with this raid, the police decided to plan a surprise raid for the following Friday night or Saturday morning, when the bar would be crowded.</FP>
  <FP>On June 28, 1969, undercover police officers raided the Stonewall Inn around 1:15 a.m., after one of them witnessed the illegal sale of alcohol. Customers resisted the police by refusing to show identification or go into a bathroom so that a police officer could verify their sex. As police officers began making arrests, the remaining customers gathered outside instead of dispersing as they had in the past. They cheered when friends emerged from the bar under police escort, and they shouted “Gay Power!” and “We Want Freedom!”. As word spread, the gathering grew in size and a riot ultimately ensued. Around 3:00 a.m., the City's riot-control force appeared, and started to push the crowd away from the Stonewall Inn. But the crowd refused to disperse. Groups of demonstrators retreated to nearby streets, only to cut back and regroup near the Stonewall Inn and Christopher Park. The riot finally abated about 4:30 a.m., but during the next week several more protests formed, and in some cases, led to new riots and confrontations with the police.</FP>
  <FP>The Stonewall Uprising changed the Nation's history. After the Stonewall incident, the LGBT community across the Nation realized its power to join together and demand equality and respect. Within days of the events, Stonewall seemed to galvanize LGBT communities across the country, bringing new supporters and inspiring LGBT activists to organize demonstrations to show support for LGBT rights in several cities. One year later, the number of LGBT organizations in the country had grown from around 50 to at least 1,500, and Pride Marches were held in a number of large cities to commemorate the Stonewall Uprising.</FP>

  <FP>The quest for LGBT equality after Stonewall evolved from protests and small gatherings into a nationwide movement. Lesbian women, gay men, <PRTPAGE P="130"/>bisexual and transgender people united to ensure equal rights for all people regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Hard-fought civil rights victories in courtrooms and statehouses across the country set the stage for victories in the Supreme Court that would have seemed unthinkable to those who rose up in Greenwich Village in June 1969. Today, communities, cities, and nations celebrate LGBT Pride Days and Months, and the number of Pride events approaches 1,000. The New York City Police Department now has an LGBT Liaison Unit to build positive relations with the LGBT community, and provides the community with expert protection when threats are identified. Most importantly, the Nation's laws and jurisprudence increasingly reflect the equal treatment that the LGBT community deserves. There is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>

The products covered by the Declaration were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round, and the requirements of section 115 of the URAA have been met.</FP>
  <FP>4. Accordingly, pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined to proclaim modifications to the tariff categories and rates of duty set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), as set forth in Annexes I and II to this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>5. Section 103(a) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (TPEA) (Public Law 114-27) amended section 506B of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “1974 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2466b) and section 103(b)(1) amended section 112(g) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(g)), to provide that in the case of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, duty-free treatment provided under title V of the 1974 Act shall remain in effect through September 30, 2025.</FP>

  <FP>6. Accordingly, pursuant to section 506B of the 1974 Act and section 112(g) of the AGOA, I have determined that general note 16(c) of the HTS is modified by striking “September 30, 2015” and by inserting in lieu thereof “September 30, 2025”.<PRTPAGE P="134"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>7. Section 103(b)(2) of the TPEA amended section 112(b)(3)(A) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(A)) to extend the regional apparel article program and section 103(b)(3) of the TPEA amended section 112(c)(1) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)(1)) to extend the third-country fabric program through September 30, 2025.</FP>
  <FP>8. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 112(b)(3)(A) and 112(c)(1) of the AGOA, I have determined that chapter 98, subchapter XIX, U.S. note 2(b) of the HTS is modified by striking “September 30, 2015” where stated in “through the period October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015” and in “each 1-year period thereafter through September 30, 2015” and by inserting in lieu thereof “September 30, 2025”.</FP>
  <FP>9. Section 104(c) of the TPEA authorizes the President to proclaim modifications that may be necessary to add the special tariff treatment symbol “D” in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTS for each article classified under a heading or subheading with the special tariff treatment symbol “A” or “A” in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTS.</FP>
  <FP>10. Accordingly, pursuant to section 104(c) of the TPEA, I have determined it is necessary to add the special tariff treatment symbol “D” in the HTS as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation.</FP>
  <FP>11. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(B)), the President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (Commission), the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from least-developed beneficiary developing countries.</FP>
  <FP>12. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(B), and 503(b)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2463(a)(1)(b), and 2463(b)(5)), and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country.</FP>
  <FP>13. Pursuant to sections 503(b)(1)(E) and 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(1)(E) and 2466A(b)(1)), the President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the AGOA when the articles are the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if, after receiving the advice of the Commission, the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.</FP>
  <FP>14. Pursuant to sections 503(b)(1)(E) and 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act, and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when the articles are the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</FP>

  <FP>15. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit application of the duty-free treatment accorded to specified articles under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>16. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined to limit the application of duty-free treatment accorded to certain articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.</FP>
  <FP>17. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) provides that beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP to eligible articles.</FP>
  <FP>18. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2015 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations, and I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.</FP>
  <FP>19. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).</FP>
  <FP>20. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.</FP>
  <FP>21. Section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) provides that the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.</FP>
  <FP>22. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by waivers of the competitive need limitations provided in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and after giving great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.</FP>
  <FP>23. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

  <P>(10) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act shall apply to the articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex VII to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2016; and<PRTPAGE P="137"/>

  <EAR>Proc. 9469</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Captive Nations Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our earliest days, the United States has worked to uphold the rights enshrined in our founding documents. The ideals that sparked our revolution find their truest expression in democracy, and our enduring belief in the right to self-govern is not limited to our borders—we believe the human impulse toward freedom is universal. During Captive Nations Week, we recognize the inherent dignity of all people, and we renew our support for those struggling under oppressive regimes and striving to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity.</FP>
  <FP>After World War II, America joined with other nations to remake the world—to rebuild, to forge a new international order, and to advance a more just and lasting peace. And following a decades-long Cold War, with strength and resolve and the power of our ideals, we rejoiced as an Iron Curtain was brought down and a new beginning was set in motion. But although more people live in democracies today—and despite the fact that we are witness to the most peaceful and prosperous era in human history—such progress is not inevitable, and dangerous forces threaten to pull the world backward.</FP>
  <FP>We must bolster our commitment to upholding freedom and democracy wherever they are jeopardized. That means ensuring the people of Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny and ensure their independence; it means helping the millions of those displaced from Syria seek a better and safer future, while continuing our efforts to bring an end to this brutal conflict and destroy ISIL. It also means discussing our differences with nations more directly. And we have opened a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba, which includes direct engagement with their government on human rights and steps to empower and create opportunity for the Cuban people.</FP>
  <FP>Around the world, a new generation of young people—connected by technology and driven by idealism and a willingness to stand up for their beliefs—is calling for more accountability in government. As heirs to a struggle for freedom that has long defined our character, Americans must lead by example and chart new paths to liberty and opportunity. We will continue to stand for equality and dignity beyond our borders and encourage economic and political reforms that foster democracy. And we remain dedicated to leading and working with others to build security, prosperity, and justice, and to fighting for any person still suffering under the grasp of tyranny.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>On July 26, 1990, our Nation marked a pivotal moment in history for Americans with disabilities. Fueled by a chorus of voices who refused to accept a second-class status and driven by a movement that recognized that our <PRTPAGE P="214"/>country is stronger and more vibrant when we draw on the talents of all our people, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) enshrined into law the notion that Americans living with disabilities deserve to participate in our society free from discrimination. Twenty-six years later, as we mark this anniversary, we recognize all this milestone law has made possible for the disability community.</FP>
  <FP>The ADA sought to guarantee that the places we share—from schools and workplaces to stadiums and parks—truly belong to everyone. It reflects our Nation's full commitment to the rights and independence of people with disabilities, and it has paved the way for a more inclusive and equal society. For the 6.5 million students and the approximately 50 million adults living with mental or physical disabilities, the ADA has swung open doors and empowered each of them to make of their lives what they will.</FP>
  <FP>Building on this progress is a priority for my Administration. The Federal Government has taken the lead in creating meaningful employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In my first term, I issued an Executive Order that called on Federal agencies and contractors to hire more people with disabilities—and today, more Americans with disabilities are working in Federal service than at any time in the last three decades. My Administration has vigorously enforced the Supreme Court's ruling in the Olmstead decision—which determined that, under the ADA, people with disabilities cannot be unnecessarily segregated—and worked to deliver on the promise that individuals with disabilities have access to integrated, community-based services. The Affordable Care Act affirmed that Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance, and this year, we made it clear that health care providers must offer reasonable accommodations and ensure effective communication for individuals with disabilities in order to advance health equity and reduce health care disparities.</FP>
  <FP>As we commemorate this progress, we know our work to expand opportunity and confront the stigma that persists surrounding disabilities is not yet finished: We have to address the injustices that linger and remove the barriers that remain. Too many people with disabilities are still unemployed and lack access to skills training or are not paid fairly for their work. We must continue increasing graduation rates for students with disabilities to give them every chance to receive the education and training they need to pursue their dreams. We must make the information and communication technologies we rely on accessible for all people, and ensure their needs are considered and incorporated as we advance the tools of modern life. And we must keep fighting for more consistent and effective enforcement of the ADA in order to prevent discrimination in public services and accommodations.</FP>
  <FP>At a time when so many doubted that people with disabilities could contribute to our economy or support their families, the ADA assumed they could, and guided the way forward. Today, as we reflect on the courage and commitment of all who made this achievement possible, let us renew our obligation to extend the promise of the American dream to all our people, and let us recommit to building a world free of unnecessary barriers and full of deeper understanding of those living with disabilities.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and <PRTPAGE P="215"/>the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2016, the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 26th anniversary of this civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with disabilities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In 1950, when Communist armies from the North stormed across the 38th parallel, brave American men and women—though weary of combat in the wake of World War II—stepped forward to defend their brothers and sisters on the Korean Peninsula. Over the course of 3 years, through unforgiving weather and severe danger, nearly 1.8 million Americans joined in the fight and faced down Communism—pushing the invading armies back and protecting a people on the other side of the world. As we mark the 63rd anniversary of the Military Armistice Agreement that brought an end to this war, we pause to honor the strength and resilience of our Korean War veterans, whose spirits and stories serve as an inspiration to continue advancing freedom's cause.</FP>
  <FP>Rising from occupation and ruin, the Republic of Korea today shines as a thriving, modern country, whose people can take comfort in knowing that the commitment of the United States to their stability and security will never waver. Fifty million South Koreans now live in freedom, reaching for their dreams and pursuing opportunities in a vibrant democracy and dynamic economy—always realizing they have a partner who will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in defense of peace and prosperity. Our lasting friendship and unbreakable alliance are sustained by the beliefs we hold in common and the values we cherish.</FP>
  <FP>As we pay tribute to the Americans who gallantly helped forge this bond, we know our solemn responsibilities to our fallen and their loved ones persist long after the battle ends. More than 7,800 Americans are still missing from the Korean War, and we will not stop working to live up to our obligations to their families. We owe all our service members an enormous debt of gratitude. To honor the full weight of the sacrifices made by those who serve, we must uphold our Nation's promise to our veterans when they return home, and fulfill our commitment to all who wear the uniform in our name.</FP>

  <FP>On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we pay tribute to the American patriots who fought for freedom and democracy throughout the Korean War, leaving behind everyone they loved to secure the blessings of liberty for a country they never knew and a people they had never met. <PRTPAGE P="216"/>For the heavy price they paid, we will forever honor the legacy of their service and uphold the ideals they secured through this hard-won victory.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2016, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor our distinguished Korean War veterans.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Health Center Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Across America, community health centers offer affordable, high-quality health care to people regardless of their financial status. For more than 50 years, underserved communities and vulnerable populations have relied on the primary and preventive care options these centers provide. During National Health Center Week, we reflect on the important role that health centers have played in delivering the comprehensive care all people deserve.</FP>
  <FP>With a strong focus on community-based and patient-centered care, health centers offer more than just treatment for illnesses and injuries; through an emphasis on education and prevention, they promote wellness and help people lead healthier lives. Anyone seeking care can locate their nearest community health center by using the “Find a Health Center” tool at www.HRSA.gov. Health centers have also played an important part in implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In addition to giving 20 million more Americans the peace of mind of having quality, affordable health insurance, the ACA has enabled health centers to add more than 950 new service delivery sites across our country. Today, nearly 1,400 health centers operate approximately 9,800 service delivery sites and provide care for nearly 23 million patients.</FP>

  <FP>Health centers are an important part of our Nation's health care system, and my Administration remains committed to supporting these facilities and the care they deliver. This year, we invested $94 million to help health centers treat people suffering from substance use disorders—including prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. We have also made new investments to build and renovate health center facilities across our country to help serve more patients and increase availability of oral health services. And because America's health centers are uniquely positioned to address <PRTPAGE P="217"/>certain public health challenges, we have increased funding to expand critical services in communities that need them most. We have made key investments to help health centers respond to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and combat the growing threat from the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.</FP>
  <FP>This week, let us thank the dedicated professionals in our community health centers who provide quality care at affordable prices. Let us build on their efforts to improve the well-being of our people and together continue working to bring about a stronger, healthier Nation for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 7 through August 13, 2016, as National Health Center Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate this week by visiting their local health center, meeting health center providers, and exploring the programs they offer to help keep families healthy.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For more than two centuries, brave patriots have given of themselves to secure our fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—and in times of both war and peace, members of the National Guard and Reserve have stood ready to don our uniform, answer our Nation's call, and protect our way of life. This week, we recognize the important role played by the families, employers, and communities of these men and women in ensuring they can step forward and serve our country when they are needed most.</FP>
  <FP>There are more than one million members of our National Guard and Reserve. Throughout the year, they dutifully train and prepare so that when they are called at a moment's notice to serve their Nation, they are able to serve with the honor and dedication that have long been hallmarks of our Armed Forces. Balancing their lives as civilians with their responsibilities in uniform, they defend and protect our people at home and abroad. In the face of natural disasters and humanitarian crises, they are quick to respond and offer assistance; during periods of conflict and strife, they help keep us safe and protect our national interests.</FP>

  <FP>These citizen-Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen deserve the full backing of their civilian employers and the promise of a secure and stable life here at home. From the businesses that seek to recruit <PRTPAGE P="218"/>and retain these patriots in the workplace to the supporters who provide leadership and resources, this unconditional care for our Guardsmen and Reservists and their families is part of what makes our military the greatest fighting force the world has ever known.</FP>
  <FP>Americans who volunteer to serve their country should always be able to partake in its opportunities. First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative has worked to make it easier for military spouses and veterans to find employment and ensure they are supported in the workforce. And my Administration has worked across all sectors to encourage communities to hire veterans and match members of the Guard and Reserve to the jobs they deserve. We must never waver in our commitment to fight for those who have fought for us, and we must continue striving to connect each of them with opportunities to keep their families strong and our country competitive.</FP>
  <FP>During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, let us honor the members of our Guard and Reserve for their steadfast dedication to us all—both in and out of uniform. And let us acknowledge the families, employers, and businesses whose encouragement and flexibility have enabled our military to thrive, and whose support has been vital to the success, stability, and security of our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 21 through August 27, 2016, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">100th Anniversary of the National Park ServiceBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>In 1872, the Congress established Yellowstone National Park—the first park of its kind anywhere in the world. Decades later, the passage of the Antiquities Act in 1906 created our first national historic preservation policy. Under this new authority, and heavily inspired by his time in nature with conservationist John Muir, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside 18 new monuments and landmarks, adding to the scattered collection of existing parks throughout our country. One decade later, in order to provide the leadership necessary for maintaining our growing system of parks, the Congress passed monumental legislation—which President Woodrow Wilson <PRTPAGE P="219"/>signed on August 25, 1916—to create the National Park Service (NPS). All existing National Parks were placed under the management of the NPS, ushering in a new era of conservation, exploration, and discovery—and securing, throughout the century that would follow, the profound legacy of an interconnected system of natural wonders.</FP>
  <FP>Over the course of the past 100 years, our national park system has grown to include more than 400 locations across our country. Ranging from seashores to waterfalls, winding trails to rugged mountains, historic battlefields to monuments and memorials, every treasured site under the NPS is uniquely American. Our parks play a critical role in environmental stewardship, ensuring that precious wildlife can thrive and that ecosystems can provide the many benefits on which we depend. They have sustained the stories and cultures that define the American experience, and they embody the people and movements that distinguish our Nation's journey.</FP>
  <FP>As we reflect on the many natural and cultural gifts that our National Parks provide, we must also look to the next century and pledge to secure our precious resources. That is why my Administration has protected over 265 million acres of public lands and waters—more than any Administration in history—and worked to save endangered and vulnerable species and their vital habitats. Climate change poses the biggest threat to our planet and our parks and is already dangerously affecting park ecosystems and visitor experiences. It is imperative that we rise to meet this challenge and continue leading the global fight against climate change to ensure that our parks remain healthy for all who will come after us.</FP>

  <FP>Often called “America's best idea,” our National Parks belong to Americans of all ages and backgrounds. NPS sites and their recreational, educational, and public health benefits are our American birthright. Last year, these sites welcomed more than 300 million visitors, and my Administration is committed to helping all our people access and enjoy these public lands and waters. Through our “Every Kid in a Park” initiative, we have made our National Parks free to fourth grade students and their families so that more children, from any community or walk of life, can spend time being active in our outdoor spaces while learning about these natural treasures—something that First Lady Michelle Obama has also advocated for through her <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative. And through the Joining Forces initiative that she and Dr. Jill Biden have championed, more of our troops and military families can enjoy our National Parks. We must expand on these programs and increase opportunities for people in underserved communities to experience the great outdoors as well. The second century of the NPS will rely on the support and engagement of young people who are visiting more parks through the “Find Your Park” campaign, and we must encourage this rising generation of Americans by inviting them to make their own personal connections to the places that have shaped our history.</FP>

  <FP>NPS parks and programs strive to tell our diverse stories, allowing us to learn from the past and help write our country's next great chapters. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, let us thank all those who—through their dedication to the mission of the NPS—help our country build on the legacy left by all those who came before us. As we look to the next century and embrace the notion that preserving these public spaces in ways that engage, reflect, and honor all Americans has never been more important, let us summon the foresight and faith in <PRTPAGE P="220"/>the future to do what it takes to protect our National Parks for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 25, 2016, as the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service. I invite all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that recognize the National Park Service for maintaining and protecting our public lands for the continued benefit and enjoyment of all Americans.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In north central Maine lies an area of the North Woods known in recent years as the Katahdin Woods and Waters Recreation Area (Katahdin Woods and Waters), approximately 87,500 acres within a larger landscape already conserved by public and private efforts starting a century ago. Katahdin Woods and Waters contains a significant piece of this extraordinary natural and cultural landscape: the mountains, woods, and waters east of Baxter State Park (home of Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail), where the East Branch of the Penobscot River and its tributaries, including the Wassataquoik Stream and the Seboeis River, run freely. Since the glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago, these waterways and associated resources—the scenery, geology, flora and fauna, night skies, and more—have attracted people to this area. Native Americans still cherish these resources. Lumberjacks, river drivers, and timber owners have earned their livings here. Artists, authors, scientists, conservationists, recreationists, and others have drawn knowledge and inspiration from this landscape.</FP>

  <FP>Katahdin Woods and Waters contains objects of significant scientific and historic interest. For some 11,000 years, Native peoples have inhabited the area, depending on its waterways and woods for sustenance. They traveled during the year from the upper reaches of the East Branch of the Penobscot River and its tributaries to coastal destinations like Frenchman and Penobscot Bays. Native peoples have traditionally used the rivers as a vast transportation network, seasonally searching for food, furs, medicines, and many other resources. Based on the results of archeological research performed in nearby areas, researchers believe that much of the archeological record of this long Native American presence in Katahdin Woods and <PRTPAGE P="221"/>Waters remains to be discovered, creating significant opportunity for scientific investigation. What is known is that the Wabanaki people, in particular the Penobscot Indian Nation, consider the Penobscot River (including the East Branch watershed) a centerpiece of their culture and spiritual values.</FP>
  <FP>The first documented Euro-American exploration of the Katahdin region dates to a 1793 survey commissioned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. After Maine achieved statehood in 1820, Major Joseph Treat, guided by John Neptune of the Penobscot Tribe, produced the first detailed maps of the region. The Maine Boundary Commission authorized a survey of the new State in 1825, for which surveyor Joseph C. Norris, Sr., and his son established the “Monument Line,” which runs through Katahdin Woods and Waters and serves as the State's east-west baseline from which township boundaries are drawn.</FP>
  <FP>By the early 19th century until the late 20th century, logging was a way of life throughout the area, as exemplified by the history of logging along the Wassataquoik Stream. To access the upstream forests, a tote road was built on the Wassataquoik's north bank around 1841; traces of the old road can still be seen in places. The earliest loggers felled enormous white pines and then “drove” them down the tumultuous stream. Beginning in the 1880s, after the choice pines were gone, the loggers switched to spruce long logs, and built camps, depots, and many dams on the Wassataquoik to control its flow for the log drives. Remnants of the Dacey and Robar Dams have been found, and discovery of more logging remnants and historic artifacts is likely. Log driving was dangerous, and many men died on the river and were buried nearby. A large fire in 1884 damaged logging operations on the Wassataquoik, and an even larger fire in 1903 put an end to the long log operations. Pulpwood operations resumed in 1910 but ceased in 1915. Other streams, like Sandy Stream, have similar logging histories.</FP>
  <FP>The East Branch of the Penobscot River and its major tributaries served as a thoroughfare for huge log drives headed toward Bangor. Log drives ended (based primarily on environmental concerns) in the 1970s, after which the timber companies relied on trucking and a network of private roads they started to build in the 1950s.</FP>
  <FP>In the 1800s, the infrastructure that developed to support the logging industry also drew hunters, anglers, and hikers to the area. In the 1830s, within 2 miles of one another on the eastern side of the Penobscot East Branch, William Hunt and Hiram Dacey established farms to serve loggers, which soon also served recreationists, scientists, and others who wanted to explore the Katahdin region or climb its mountains. Just across the East Branch from the Hunt and Dacey Farms (the latter now the site of Lunksoos Camps) lies the entrance to the Wassataquoik Stream. In 1848, the Reverend Marcus Keep established what is still called Keep Path, running along the Wassataquoik to Katahdin Lake and on to Mount Katahdin. From that time until the end of the 19th century, the favored entryway to the Katahdin region started on the east side of Mount Katahdin with a visit to Hunt or Dacey Farm, then crossed the East Branch and ascended the valley of the Wassataquoik Stream.</FP>

  <FP>Henry David Thoreau—who made the “Maine Woods” famous through his publications—approached from the headwaters of the East Branch to the north. With his Penobscot guide Joe Polis and companion Edward Hoar in <PRTPAGE P="222"/>1857, on his last and longest trip to the area, he paddled past Dacey Farm with just a brief stop at Hunt Farm. He wrote about his two nights in the Katahdin Woods and Waters area—the first at what he named the “Checkerberry-tea camp,” near the oxbow just upriver from Stair Falls, and the second on the river between Dacey and Hunt Farms where he drank hemlock tea.</FP>
  <FP>During his 1879 Maine trip on which he summited Mount Katahdin, Theodore Roosevelt followed the route across the East Branch and up the Wassataquoik. As Roosevelt later recalled, he lost one of his hiking boots crossing the Wassataquoik but, undaunted, completed the challenging trek in moccasins. Many including Roosevelt himself have observed that his several trips to the Katahdin region in the late 1870s had a significant impact on his life, as he overcame longstanding health problems, gained strength and stamina, experienced the wonder of nature and the desire to conserve it, and made friends for life from the Maine Woods.</FP>
  <FP>Native Mainer Percival P. Baxter, too, followed this route on the 1920 trip that solidified his determination to create a large park from this landscape. Burton Howe, a Patten lumberman, organized this trip of Maine notables, who stayed at Lunksoos Camps before their ascent via the established route. As a State representative, senator, and governor, Baxter had proposed legislation to create a Mount Katahdin park in commemoration of the State's centennial, and the 1920 trip cemented his profound appreciation of the landscape. Spurned by the Maine legislature, Baxter devoted his life to acquiring 28 parcels of land, largely from timber companies who had heavily logged them, and donated them to the State with management instructions and an endowment, resulting in the establishment of Baxter State Park.</FP>

  <FP>Artists and photographers have left indelible images of their time spent in the area. In 1832, John James Audubon canoed the East Branch and sketched natural features for his masterpiece <E T="03">Birds of America.</E> Frederic Edwin Church, the preeminent landscape artist of the Hudson River School, first visited the area in the 1850s, and in 1877 invited his landscape-painter colleagues to join him on a well-publicized expedition from Hunt Farm up the Wassataquoik Stream to capture varied views of Mount Katahdin and environs. In the early 1900s, George H. Hallowell painted and photographed the log drives on the Wassataquoik Stream, and Carl Sprinchorn painted logging activities on the Seboeis River.</FP>

  <FP>Geologists were among the earliest scientists to visit the area. While surveys were done in the 1800s, in-depth geological research and mapping of the area did not begin until the 1950s. These mid-20th century geologists found bedrock spanning over 150 million years of the Paleozoic era, revealing a remarkably complete exposure of Paleozoic rock strata with well-preserved fossils. The lands west of the Penobscot East Branch are dominated by volcanic and granitic rock from the Devonian period, mostly Katahdin Granite but also Traveler Rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock that is similar in composition to granite. The oldest rock in Katahdin Woods and Waters, a light greenish-gray quartzite interlayered with slate from the early Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago), can be observed along the riverbank of the Penobscot East Branch for over 1,000 feet at the Grand Pitch (a river rapid). This rock is part of the Weeksboro-Lunksoos Lake anticline, a broad upward fold of rocks originally deposited horizontally, <PRTPAGE P="223"/>which is evidence of mountain-building tectonics. The fold continues north along the river and then turns northeast toward Shin Pond, exposing successive bands of younger Paleozoic rock of both volcanic and sedimentary origin on either side of the structure.</FP>
  <FP>Various formations in the area provide striking visual evidence of marine waters in Katahdin Woods and Waters during the geologic periods that immediately followed the Cambrian period. For example, Owen Brook limestone, an outcrop of calcareous bedrock west of the Penobscot East Branch containing fossil brachiopods, is of coral reef origin. Pillow lavas, such as those near the summit of Lunksoos Mountain, were produced by underwater eruptions. Haskell Rock, the 20-foot-tall pillar in the midst of a Penobscot East Branch rapid, is conglomerate bedrock that suggests a time of dynamic transition from volcanic islands to an ocean with underwater sedimentation. This conglomerate, deposited about 450 million years ago, contains volcanic and sedimentary stones of various sizes, and occurs in outcrops and boulders in several locations.</FP>
  <FP>The area's geology also provides prominent evidence of large and powerful earth-changing events. During the Paleozoic era (541 to 252 million years ago), mountain-building events contributed to the rise of the primordial Appalachian Mountain range and the amalgamation of the supercontinent Pangaea. Following the last mountain-building event, significant erosion reshaped the topography, helping to expose the cores of volcanoes, the Katahdin pluton, and the structure of the previous mountain-building events. About 200 million years ago, Pangaea began splitting apart as the Atlantic Ocean appeared and North America, Europe, and Africa formed. Today, the International Appalachian Trail, a long-distance hiking trail, seeks to follow the ancestral Appalachian-Caledonian Mountains on both sides of the Atlantic, starting at Katahdin Lake in Baxter State Park near the northern end of the domestic Appalachian Trail, traversing Katahdin Woods and Waters for about 30 miles, and proceeding through Canada for resumption across the Atlantic.</FP>
  <FP>In more recent geological history, during the approximately 2.5 million year-long Pleistocene epoch that ended approximately 12,000 years ago, repeated glaciations covered the region, eroding bedrock and shaping the modern landscape. Glacial till from the most recent glaciations underlies much of the area's soil, moraines occur in several locations, and glacial erratics are common. Prominent eskers—long, snaking ridges of sand and gravel deposited by glacial meltwater—occur along most of the Penobscot East Branch and the Wassataquoik Stream. Glacial landforms, glacial scoured bedrock, and the lake sediments in the area, deposited only since the retreat of the last glaciers, record a history of intense climate change that gave rise to the modern topography of the area.</FP>
  <FP>This post-glacial topography is studded with attractive small mountains, including some like Deasey, Lunksoos, and Barnard, that offer spectacular views of Mount Katahdin. Katahdin Woods and Waters abuts much of Baxter State Park's eastern boundary, extending the conservation landscape through shared mountains, streams, corridors for plants and animals, and other natural systems.</FP>

  <FP>Among the defining natural features of Katahdin Woods and Waters is the East Branch of the Penobscot River system, including its major tributaries, <PRTPAGE P="224"/>the Seboeis River and the Wassataquoik Stream, and many smaller tributaries. Known as one of the least developed watersheds in the northeastern United States, the Penobscot East Branch River system has a stunning concentration of hydrological features in addition to its significant geology and ecology. From the northern boundary of Katahdin Woods and Waters, the main stem of the East Branch drops over 200 feet in about 10 miles through a series of rapids and waterfalls—including Stair Falls, Haskell Rock Pitch, Pond Pitch, Grand Pitch, the Hulling Machine, and Bowlin Falls.</FP>
  <FP>After Bowlin Brook, the main stem declines more gently south toward Whetstone Falls and below, embroidered with many side channels and associated floodplain forests and open streamshores. Of the two major tributaries, the Seboeis River flows in from the east, and the Wassataquoik Stream from the west, the latter dropping over 500 feet in its approximately 14-mile wild run from the border of Baxter State Park to its confluence with the Penobscot East Branch main stem.</FP>
  <FP>The extraordinary significance of the Penobscot East Branch River system has long been recognized. A 1977 Department of the Interior study determined that the East Branch of the Penobscot River, including the Wassataquoik Stream, qualifies for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System based on its outstandingly remarkable values, and a 1982 Federal-State study of rivers in Maine determined that the Penobscot East Branch River System, including both the Wassataquoik Stream and the Seboeis River, ranks in the highest category of natural and recreational rivers and possesses nationally significant resource values.</FP>
  <FP>In recent years, a multi-party public-private project has taken steps to reconnect the Penobscot River with the sea through the removal and retrofitting of downstream dams. This river restoration will likely further enhance the integrity of the Penobscot East Branch river system, and provide opportunities for scientific study of the effects of the restoration on upstream areas within Katahdin Woods and Waters. It will also allow federally endangered Atlantic salmon to return to the upper reaches of the river known in the Penobscot language as “Wassetegweweck,” or “the place where they spear fish.” The return of ocean-run Atlantic salmon to this watershed would complement the exceptional native brook trout fishery for which Katahdin Woods and Waters is known today.</FP>
  <FP>Katahdin Woods and Waters possesses significant biodiversity. Spanning three ecoregions, it displays the transition between northern boreal and southern broadleaf deciduous forests, providing a unique and important opportunity for scientific investigation of the effects of climate change across ecotones. The forests include mixed hardwoods like sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch; mixed forests with hardwoods, hemlock, and white pine; and spruce-fir forests with balsam fir, red spruce, and birches. In wetland areas, black spruce, white spruce, red maple, and tamarack dominate.</FP>

  <FP>Although significant portions of the area have been logged in recent years, the regenerating forests retain connectivity and provide significant biodiversity among plant and animal communities, enhancing their ecological resilience. With the complex matrix of microclimates represented, the area likely contains the attributes needed to sustain natural ecological function in the face of climate change, and provide natural strongholds for species <PRTPAGE P="225"/>into the future. These forests also afford connections and scientific comparisons with the forests on adjacent State land, including Baxter State Park, which was logged heavily before its parcel-by-parcel purchase by former Governor Percival Baxter between 1931 and 1963.</FP>
  <FP>Of particular scientific significance are the number and quality of small and medium-sized patch ecosystems throughout the area, tending to occur in less common topography that is often relatively remote or inaccessible. Hilltops and barrens often protect rare flora and fauna, such as the blueberry-lichen barren and associated spruce-heath barren found between Robar and Eastern Brooks, and the three-toothed cinquefoil-blueberry low summit bald atop Lunksoos Mountain, where rattlesnake hawkweed can be found. Cliffs and steep slopes, like those present along the ridge from Deasey Mountain to Little Spring Brook Mountain and on the eastern sides of Billfish and Traveler Mountains, harbor exemplary rock outcrop ecosystems that often include flora of special interest, such as fragrant cliff wood-fern and purple clematis. Ravines and coves can support enriched forests like the maple-basswood-ash community found below the eastern cliffs of Lunksoos Mountain, with trees over 250 years old and associated rare plants including squirrel-corn. The Appalachian-Acadian rivershore ecosystems of the Penobscot East Branch and its two major tributaries are considered exemplary in Maine, with occurrences of beautiful silver maple floodplain forest and hardwood river terrace forest—rare and imperiled natural communities, respectively, in the State. A nationally significant diversity of high quality wetlands and wet basins occurs throughout Katahdin Woods and Waters, including smaller streams and brooks, ponds, swamps, bogs, and fens. Patch forests of various types also occur throughout the area, such as a red-pine woodland forest on small hills and ridges amid the large Mud Brook Flowage wetland in the southwestern section.</FP>
  <FP>The expanse of Katahdin Woods and Waters, augmented by its location next to other large conservation properties including Baxter State Park and additional State reservations, supports many wide-ranging wildlife species including ruffed grouse, moose, black bear, white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, American marten, bobcat, bald eagle, northern goshawk, and the federally threatened Canada lynx. Seventy-eight bird species are known to breed in the area, and many more bird species use it. Visitation and study of the area have been limited to date, as compared with other areas like Baxter State Park, and many more species of birds and other wildlife may be present.</FP>
  <FP>Certain wildlife species are known to occur in specific patch ecosystems in the area, such as the short-eared owl in hilltops and barrens, and the silver-haired bat and the wood turtle in floodplain forests. Mussels such as the tidewater mucket and yellow lampmussel live in some of the brooks and streams, and rare invertebrates like the copper butterfly, pygmy snaketail dragonfly, Tomah mayfly, and Roaring Brook mayfly inhabit some of its bogs and fens.</FP>

  <FP>Katahdin Woods and Waters's daytime scenery is awe-inspiring, from the breadth of its mountain-studded landscape, to the channels of its free-flowing streams with their rapids, falls, and quiet water, to its vantages for viewing the Mount Katahdin massif, the “greatest mountain.” The area's <PRTPAGE P="226"/>night skies rival this experience, glittering with stars and planets and occasional displays of the aurora borealis, in this area of the country known for its dark sky.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9477</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's Equality Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Nearly one century ago, with boundless courage and relentless commitment, dedicated women who had marched, advocated, and organized for the right to cast a vote finally saw their efforts rewarded on August 26, 1920, when the 19th Amendment was certified and the right to vote was secured. In the decades that followed, that precious right has bolstered generations of women and empowered them to stand up, speak out, and steer the country they love in a more equal direction. Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of this hard-won achievement and pay tribute to the trailblazers and suffragists who moved us closer to a more just and prosperous future, we resolve to protect this constitutional right and pledge to continue fighting for equality for women and girls.</FP>
  <FP>At every level of society, women are leaders at the forefront of progress. Serving as judges and Members of Congress, setting world records in sports, founding groundbreaking companies, and fighting on the front lines of combat, women continue to tear down barriers and shatter glass ceilings—just as they have done since the founding of our Nation. Yet such progress is not inevitable, and we must keep moving forward on our journey toward equality. In one of my first acts as President, I established the White House Council on Women and Girls to provide a coordinated response to challenges confronted by women and girls, ensuring their concerns and insights are taken into account in our policies and programs. And this year, my Administration hosted the first-ever United State of Women Summit to continue our efforts to underscore the passion, success, and ongoing commitment of advocates dedicated to advancing gender equality and realizing a brighter future for women of all ages.</FP>
  <FP>No woman should earn less than a man for doing the same job—equal pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy and our democracy. That is why the first bill I signed into law as President was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Women make up roughly half of our workforce, and we need to invest more in affordable, high-quality childcare. We must strengthen paid sick, maternity, and family leave—too many families are forced to make difficult choices between caring for a newborn and receiving a paycheck, or staying home to help a sick child or parent and keeping their job. And we must continue striving for fairness and opportunity when it comes to improving workplace policies, because we know that when women succeed, our economy and our country succeed.</FP>

  <FP>Ensuring all young women can live full and healthy lives is vital to their pursuit of personal and professional goals. Because of the Affordable Care Act, individuals can no longer be charged higher premiums simply for being a woman. But there is still more we can do to reduce discrimination when it comes to women's health—such as protecting a woman's right to choose and safeguarding access to sexual and reproductive health services, including abortion. Every person should be able to live and reach for their <PRTPAGE P="230"/>dreams free from fear of violence: In America, nearly one in four women has suffered physical domestic violence, a cruelty which deprives its victims of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and inhibits them from reaching their full potential. Approximately one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college. Through the It's On Us campaign and the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault, we have called on individuals, communities, and institutions of higher education to recognize what they can do to stop sexual assault and change our culture for the better. We have striven to support survivors and focused on making sure our schools are safe places where all students can learn, grow, and thrive. Transgender women often face escalated levels of discrimination and violence, and we have taken a number of steps to secure their civil rights, including providing guidance to educators that can help rid school environments of discrimination. The Department of Justice has also urged law enforcement agencies to address any form of gender bias that exists in responding to domestic violence and sexual assault and ensure that such bias does not undermine efforts to keep victims safe.</FP>

  <FP>Underrepresented in management positions, underfunded as entrepreneurs, under-encouraged in STEM fields, and confronted with higher levels of unemployment, women and girls of color still face very real challenges, significant opportunity gaps, and structural barriers. That is why we have hosted forums to discuss ways to increase programming and promote opportunities for women and girls of color so they can achieve success at school, at work, and in their communities. To continue building these ladders of opportunity for women—not just in communities across our country, but also around the world—I have made advancing gender equality a foreign policy priority. My Administration has sought to end gender-based violence across the globe, promote the role of women in ending conflict and building lasting peace and security, and empower the next generation by investing in adolescent girls and breaking down barriers to get 62 million girls into schools through the <E T="03">Let Girls Learn</E> initiative.</FP>
  <FP>In the many decades since suffragists organized and mobilized, countless advocates and leaders have picked up the mantle and moved our Nation and our world forward. Today, young women in America grow up knowing an historic truth—that not only can they cast a vote, but they can also run for office and help shape the very democracy that once left them out. For these women, and for generations of women to come, we must keep building a more equal America—whether through the stories we tell about our Nation's history or the faces we display on our country's currency. On Women's Equality Day, as we recognize the accomplishments that so many women fought so hard to achieve, we rededicate ourselves to tackling the challenges that remain and expanding opportunity for women and girls everywhere.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2016, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women and promote gender equality.<PRTPAGE P="231"/>

  <PROC>Proclamation 9478 of August 26, 2016</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9478</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument ExpansionBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Through Proclamation 8031 of June 15, 2006, as amended by Proclamation 8112 of February 28, 2007, the President established the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (Monument), to protect and preserve the marine area of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the historic and scientific objects therein. As stated in Proclamation 8031, the area, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Battle of Midway National Memorial, and the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, supports a dynamic reef ecosystem with more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. This diverse ecosystem is home to many species of coral, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other flora and fauna, including the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the threatened green sea turtle, and the endangered leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles. In addition, this area has great cultural significance to the Native Hawaiian community and a connection to early Polynesian culture worthy of protection and understanding.</FP>
  <FP>An area adjacent to the Monument, and that will constitute the Monument Expansion as set forth in this proclamation, includes the waters and submerged lands to the extent of the seaward limit of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (U.S. EEZ) west of 163° West Longitude, and extending from the boundaries depicted on the map accompanying Proclamation 8031 as amended by Proclamation 8112 (adjacent area).</FP>
  <FP>As required by the Antiquities Act, the adjacent area contains objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government; they are geological and biological resources that are part of a highly pristine deep sea and open ocean ecosystem with unique biodiversity and that constitute a sacred cultural, physical, and spiritual place for the Native Hawaiian community.</FP>

  <FP>This unique ecosystem has many significant features. Important geological features of the adjacent area include more than 75 seamounts, as well as a non-volcanic ridge that extends southwest towards the Johnston Atoll. Together, these features form biodiverse hotspots in the open ocean that provide habitat for deep-sea species, including sponges, other invertebrates, fish, and colonies of corals many thousands of years old. Recent science demonstrates that seamounts harbor a multitude of species with unique ecological traits, some newly discovered. Seamounts, ridges, and other undersea topographic features are important stepping stones that enable marine organisms to spread throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, and between <PRTPAGE P="232"/>Hawaii and other archipelagoes. Undisturbed seamount communities in the adjacent area are of significant scientific interest because they provide opportunities to examine the impacts of physical, biological, and geological processes on ecosystem diversity, including understanding the impacts of climate change on these deep-sea communities. These seamounts and ridges also provide the opportunity for identification and discovery of many species not yet known to humans, with possible implications for research, medicine, and other important uses.</FP>
  <FP>Recent scientific research, utilizing new technology, has shown that many species identified as objects in Proclamation 8031 inhabit previously unknown geographical ranges that span beyond the existing Monument, and in some cases the adjacent area also provides important foraging habitat for these species. For example, the endangered Hawaiian monk seal forages well beyond the existing Monument. Scientific research on Hawaiian monk seal foraging behavior has shown that monk seals may travel 80 miles and dive to depths of almost 2,000 feet while feeding.</FP>
  <FP>Important bird species abound in the Monument and the adjacent area. Birds from the world's largest colonies of Laysan albatross, Black-footed albatross, and Bonin petrels, as well as significant populations of shearwaters, petrels, tropicbirds, the endangered Short-tailed albatross, and other seabird species forage in the adjacent area. We now know that albatrosses and Great Frigatebirds rely on the adjacent area during chick-brooding periods, when their foraging is focused within 200 miles of the nesting colonies on the Monument's islands and atolls. At other times, these wide-ranging species use a much broader range (over 1,600 miles) for foraging.</FP>
  <FP>The adjacent area is a foraging and migration path for five species of protected sea turtles. While green and hawksbill turtles use the near-shore waters of the Monument for nesting, these species—along with the endangered leatherback turtle and threatened loggerhead and olive ridley turtles—migrate through the adjacent area to reach high-productivity foraging areas.</FP>
  <FP>Twenty-four species of whales and dolphins have been sighted in the adjacent area. Three of these species are listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened or endangered: sperm whales, fin whales, and sei whales. Cetacean use of the Monument Expansion varies; resident species such as spinner dolphins, false killer whales, and rough-toothed dolphins utilize the area year-round, whereas other species, such as humpback whales, use it as a wintering area. A wide variety of tropical and temperate water dolphin species inhabit the Monument Expansion, including pantropical spotted dolphins, spinner dolphins, striped dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins. Several rarely sighted species of dolphin inhabit the area, including Risso's and Fraser's dolphins. Both of these species are primarily oceanic and found in waters deeper than 1,000 meters. Acoustic evidence also shows that endangered blue whales—the largest animals on Earth—visit the area and may migrate past the Hawaiian Islands twice a year.</FP>

  <FP>Sharks, including tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks, are key species in the ecosystems of the Monument and adjacent area. These large and highly mobile predators have expansive home ranges and regularly move across the boundaries of the current Monument into the adjacent waters. Additionally, <PRTPAGE P="233"/>blue sharks, three species of thresher sharks, and two species of mako sharks inhabit the open ocean environment of the adjacent area.</FP>
  <FP>The Monument and adjacent area are part of the most remote island archipelago on Earth. This biological and geographic isolation, coupled with unique oceanographic and geological conditions, has resulted in an ecosystem critical for new species formation and endemism. These forces result in some of the most unique and diverse ecological communities on the planet.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="03">Importance to Native Hawaiian Culture</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>The ocean will always be seen as an integral part of cultural identity for the Native Hawaiian community. The deep sea, the ocean surface, the sky, and all the living things in the area adjacent to the Monument are important to this culture and are deeply rooted in creation and settlement stories. Native Hawaiian culture considers the Monument and the adjacent area a sacred place. This place contains the boundary between Ao, the world of light and the living, and Pō, the world of the gods and spirits from which all life is born and to which ancestors return after death. Long-distance voyaging and wayfinding is one of the most unique and valuable traditional practices that the Native Hawaiian community has developed and continues to advance. Once on the verge of cultural extinction, new double-hulled sailing canoes, beginning with the Hōkūle'a in the 1970s, are bringing voyaging and wayfinding to new generations. This traditional practice relies on celestial, biological, and natural signs, such as winds, waves, currents and the presence of birds and marine life. The open ocean ecosystem and its natural resources in the adjacent area play an important role within the cultural voyaging seascape within the Hawaiian Archipelago.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="03">Shipwrecks</E>
  </FP>

  <FP>World War II shipwrecks and aircraft in the adjacent area, though not identified as objects under the Antiquities Act in this proclamation, are of great historic interest. The naval portion of the Battle of Midway, one of the most important naval battles of World War II, occurred approximately 200 miles to the northeast of Midway Atoll, in the adjacent area. Deep-sea technologies have enabled the <E T="03">USS Yorktown,</E> an aircraft carrier torpedoed during the battle, to be found at more than 16,000 feet below the ocean's surface. Eyewitness accounts and historical records tell the stories of the destroyer <E T="03">USS Hammann,</E> five Japanese vessels (the four aircraft carriers <E T="03">Hiryu, Soryu, Kaga,</E> and <E T="03">Akagi,</E> and the cruiser <E T="03">Mikuma</E>), and several hundred aircraft that were also lost during the battle in this area. The locations of these vessels have yet to be identified. All told, the adjacent area serves as a final resting place for the more than 3,000 people lost during the battle.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, the waters and submerged lands adjacent to the Monument (west of 163° West Longitude and seaward from the boundaries delineated in Proclamation 8031 as amended by Proclamation 8112 out to the limit of the U.S. EEZ) contain objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government;</FP>

  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned <PRTPAGE P="234"/>or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to preserve the marine environment, including the waters and submerged lands in the U.S. EEZ west of 163° West Longitude adjacent to Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for the care and management of the historic and scientific objects therein;</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, the well-being of the United States, the prosperity of its citizens and the protection of the ocean environment are complementary and reinforcing priorities; and the United States continues to act with due regard for the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea enjoyed by other nations under the law of the sea in managing the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and adjacent areas, and does not compromise the readiness, training, and global mobility of the U.S. Armed Forces when establishing marine protected areas;</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be part of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Expansion (Monument Expansion) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled “Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Expansion” attached hereto, which forms a part of this proclamation. The Monument Expansion comprises the waters and submerged lands in the U.S. EEZ west of 163° West Longitude adjacent to the Monument. The Federal lands and interests in lands reserved consist of approximately 442,781 square miles, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.</FP>
  <FP>All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the Monument Expansion are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land laws to the extent that those laws apply, including but not limited to, withdrawal from location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to development of oil and gas, minerals, geothermal, or renewable energy. Lands and interest in lands within the Monument Expansion not owned or controlled by the United States shall be reserved as part of the Monument Expansion upon acquisition of title or control by the United States.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Management of the Marine National Monument</E>
  </FP>

  <FP>Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument or any of the provisions specified in Proclamations 8031 and 8112. Terms used in this proclamation shall have the same meaning as those defined in Proclamation 8031. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (Secretaries) shall share management responsibility for the Monument Expansion. The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall have <PRTPAGE P="235"/>responsibility for management of activities and species within the Monument Expansion under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by NOAA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and any other applicable Department of Commerce legal authorities. The Secretary of the Interior, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the Monument Expansion under its applicable legal authorities, including the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, the Refuge Recreation Act, and the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by FWS), and Public Law 98-532 and Executive Order 6166 of June 10, 1933.</FP>

  <FP>Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce should consider initiating the process under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) to designate the Monument Expansion area and the Monument seaward of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial as a National Marine Sanctuary to supplement and complement existing authorities.</FP>

  <FP>The Secretaries shall prepare a joint management plan, within their respective authorities and after consultation with the State of Hawaii, for the Monument Expansion within 3 years of the date of this proclamation, and shall promulgate as appropriate implementing regulations, within their respective authorities, that address any further specific actions necessary for the proper care and management of the objects and areas identified in this proclamation. The Secretaries shall revise and update the management plan as necessary. In developing and implementing any management plans and any management rules and regulations, the Secretaries shall consult, designate, and involve as cooperating agencies the agencies with jurisdiction or special expertise, including the Department of Defense and Department of State, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and its implementing regulations.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every day, millions of Americans prove that recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders is possible—yet at the same time, millions more are struggling with the disease of addiction. These individuals are our family members, friends, and neighbors, and when they are not able to get the help they need, our communities and our country are not as strong as they can be. It is up to all of us to help our loved ones seek life-saving services when needed and steer them toward recovery. Throughout this month, we celebrate the successes of all those who know the transformative power of recovery, and we renew our commitment to providing the support, care, and treatment that people need to forge a healthier life.</FP>
  <FP>Substance use disorder, commonly known as addiction, is a disease of the brain, and many misconceptions surrounding it have contributed to harmful stigmas that can prevent individuals from seeking the treatment they need. By treating substance use disorders as seriously as other medical conditions, with an emphasis on prevention and treatment, people can recover. This month's theme is, “Join the Voices for Recovery: Our Families, Our Stories, Our Recovery!”. Focusing on the importance of family support throughout recovery, it invites families, loved ones, and other individuals to share their stories and triumphs in fighting substance use disorders to inspire others that may follow in their footsteps. I encourage all Americans looking for assistance to use the “Treatment Locator” tool at www.SAMHSA.gov or call 1-800-662-HELP.</FP>

  <FP>This disease can touch any American in any community, and my Administration has made combatting substance use disorders a priority. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must now cover substance use disorder services as essential health benefits. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires health plans that cover mental health and substance use disorder treatment to provide coverage that is comparable to that of medical and surgical care. Through our National Drug Control Strategy—a 21st century approach to reducing drug use and its consequences—we have promoted evidence-based health and safety initiatives that aim to prevent drug use, increase opportunities for early intervention and integrated treatment in health care, and support recovery. In response to our Nation's opioid overdose epidemic, we are highlighting tools that can help reduce drug use and overdose, such as evidence-based prevention programs, prescription drug take-back events, medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorders, and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. That is why, in my most recent budget proposal, I proposed investing $1 billion to expand access to treatment for prescription opioid misuse and heroin use. I will continue urging the Congress to fund treatment like I have proposed—because if they fund these efforts, we can help more individuals across our country seek help, complete treatment, and sustain recovery.<PRTPAGE P="241"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, let us thank health care professionals, support groups, and all those dedicated to helping individuals in need find assistance and reclaim their lives. Let us continue working to address substance use disorders in our communities and promote the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Childhood obesity has both immediate and long-term effects on a child's health and well-being—it puts our young people at higher risk for health problems in adulthood and it can strain our economy in the years ahead. But collaborative efforts in recent years have helped our Nation make progress and begin to reverse these trends. By fostering environments that support healthy choices and giving families the knowledge and resources they need to make smart decisions, we can move closer toward ensuring all our children grow up healthy. Every September, as children begin the new school year, we recommit to solving the epidemic of childhood obesity within the next generation.</FP>

  <FP>Over the course of my Presidency, we have put forward new programs, policies, and initiatives that put children on a path to a healthy future. At the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative, I established the first-ever Task Force on Childhood Obesity to develop a national action plan to mobilize the public and private sectors and engage families and communities in an effort to improve the health of our children. Combining comprehensive strategies with common sense, <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> is focused on helping children lead a healthier life during their earliest months and years; providing healthier foods in our schools; ensuring every family has access to healthy, affordable food; and getting children to become more physically active. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring all of our kids grow up healthy, including parents and caregivers, elected officials from all levels of government, schools, health care professionals, faith-based and community-based organizations, and the private sector. For the past 5 years we have welcomed students to the White House from across our Nation to create original and healthy recipes in our annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge and Kids' “State Dinner.” The First Lady has also invited students <PRTPAGE P="242"/>to join her in planting and harvesting the White House Kitchen Garden to learn about where their food comes from and experience firsthand how healthy food can be fun and delicious.</FP>
  <FP>Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration introduced a modernized Nutrition Facts label—which includes more realistic serving sizes and information on added sugars—to provide families with the accurate information they need to make healthy choices. We know there is a strong connection between what our kids eat and how well they perform in school, too. That is why, in 2010, I signed the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a law that improves the quality of school meals and snacks for over 50 million students so they have the fuel they need to focus on their education and grow up healthy. A recent study showed that because of the increased availability and variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, students have been empowered to make healthier choices since these standards were updated. The Act increased the number of students who could get school meals at little or no cost and ensured that any food or beverage marketed to children at school meets specific nutrition standards. It also helped bring about the first major revision of nutrition standards for the Child and Adult Care Food Program since its inception more than 40 years ago.</FP>

  <FP>In addition to improving the nutrition of the food our children eat, we will keep striving to create opportunities for kids to become more physically active. The <E T="03">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</E> recommend that kids be active for at least 60 minutes every day, but less than one-third of teenagers have met that goal in recent years. Last year, the Surgeon General called on communities to recognize the importance of exercise by walking more and by improving the walkability of our neighborhoods. Through our “Every Kid in a Park” initiative, we have opened up our National Parks to fourth graders and their families for free, so that children from all backgrounds, parts of the country, and walks of life can get outdoors more easily.</FP>
  <FP>This year, as we observe National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, let us renew our commitment to giving America's daughters and sons a healthy start in life. Let us continue to encourage parents and caregivers to make nutritious choices and help their children do the same, improve access to healthy and affordable foods in our communities and our schools, and promote active lifestyles. We must each do our part to reduce childhood obesity and empower our children to reach for the brighter, healthier future they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to learn about and engage in activities that promote healthy eating and greater physical activity by all our Nation's children.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9481</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Preparedness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Americans have been tested by trial and tragedy since our earliest days—but year after year, no matter the hardship, we pull through and forge ahead. Fifteen years after the attacks of September 11, we reflect on our strength as a Nation when anything threatens us. Today, as the residents of Louisiana mourn the loss of loved ones and face tremendous damage caused by historic floods, we are reminded of what Americans do in times like these—we see the power of love and community among neighbors who step up to help in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Preparing ourselves to meet the unknown challenges of tomorrow is a duty we all share, and when confronted with crisis or calamity, we need to have done everything possible to prepare. During National Preparedness Month, we emphasize the importance of readying ourselves and our communities to be resilient in the face of any emergency we may encounter.</FP>
  <FP>Although my Administration continues doing everything we can to keep the American people safe, it is each citizen's responsibility to be as prepared as possible for emergencies. Whether in the form of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, or unspeakable acts of evil like terrorism, danger can arise at unexpected times and places. Fortunately, there are many things that individuals, families, and communities can do to improve their readiness. I encourage all Americans to take proactive steps to prepare for any situation that may occur—including signing up for local alerts, checking insurance coverage, documenting valuables, creating a plan for emergency communication and evacuation, and having a fully stocked disaster supply kit on hand. And I encourage those in the business community to prepare their employees, develop a business continuity plan, and engage in community-level planning to help ensure our communities and private sector remain strong when faced with an emergency. For information on how to better prepare for emergencies that are common in your area, or to learn about resources that may be available for increasing preparedness, visit www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov.</FP>
  <FP>In the face of unpredictable threats and hazards, we are committed to improving access to information and raising awareness of the importance of precautionary measures. Leaders across our country should take the time to review the 2016 National Preparedness Report and find ways to address the vulnerabilities it highlights. All Americans can play a role in fulfilling our National Preparedness Goal by addressing the risks that affect them and participating in preparedness activities across our Nation.</FP>

  <FP>We continue to collaborate with State, local, and tribal partners, along with those in the public and private sectors, to ensure that communities in crisis do not have to face these dangers alone. In addition to coordinating relief efforts and providing rapid response, we have focused on supporting the needs of survivors, investing in affected neighborhoods, and helping them rebuild their communities to be better, stronger, and more resilient. Federal agencies are also working to share resources with the public, promote the <PRTPAGE P="244"/>tools and technologies that could help during disasters, and offer preparation strategies. We launched America's PrepareAthon! to bring communities together and help them plan for emergencies, and on September 30, we encourage a national day of action to spur preparedness efforts from coast to coast.</FP>
  <FP>Disasters have become more frequent and severe as our climate changes; both urban and rural areas are already feeling the devastating consequences, including severe droughts and higher sea levels, intense storms and wildfires, and more powerful hurricanes and heat waves. Climate change poses an imminent and lasting threat to our safety and national security, and it is critical that we invest in our infrastructure and integrate the preparedness efforts of our communities to improve our ability to respond to and recover from the effects of our changing climate and extreme weather events.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we pay tribute to the courageous individuals who rush to the scene of disaster for their dedication to our safety and security, no matter the price. Let us recognize that each of us can do our part to prepare for emergencies, help those affected by disasters, and ensure all our people have the necessary resources and knowledge to protect themselves. Together, we will remain strong and resilient no matter what befalls us.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our resilience and readiness.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Wilderness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>In our Nation's earliest days, a vast majority of North America was wilderness—from majestic plains and imposing mountain ranges to dense forests and rushing waterways. Today, protected wild spaces continue to serve as a backdrop for curious and adventurous Americans to seek the thrill and joy of connecting with the sacred spirit of our country's wilderness, offering a wide variety of activities including hiking, camping, and climbing. This month, as we cherish our vast and vibrant natural heritage, we resolve to preserve its splendors for all who will follow in our footsteps.<PRTPAGE P="245"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Aiming to leave future generations with a “glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning,” President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law two historic pieces of legislation that opened a new chapter in American conservation—the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Wilderness Act defined our untrammeled lands as wilderness and created the National Wilderness Preservation System, recognizing forests, parks, and wildlife refuges as having intrinsic value as wild lands worth protecting. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was established out of a bipartisan commitment to ensure that we can protect lands and waters for use and enjoyment by all our people; throughout the last 50 years it has supported conservation efforts in every State, including tens of thousands of State and local projects through billions of dollars in grants. But a lack of full and secure funding hinders many important LWCF projects that protect critical habitats and provide recreational opportunities—which is why I keep calling on the Congress to pursue permanent funding for the LWCF.</FP>
  <FP>Our great outdoors are home to some of the richest and most beautiful ecosystems and resources on the planet, and my Administration has made protecting them a priority. Climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time, is already harming many of our wild spaces, which is one important reason why I have pushed for stronger action to cut greenhouse gas pollution and strengthen the resilience of our ecosystems to rising temperatures. In my first year in office, I signed the most extensive expansion of conservation efforts in more than a generation. Since then, my Administration has protected hundreds of millions of acres of land and water, more than any Administration in history. Through our America's Great Outdoors initiative, we have worked with local, State, and tribal partners to build a conservation agenda worthy of the 21st century. And to ensure more Americans can experience everything the wilderness has to offer, we launched the “Every Kid in a Park” initiative, giving fourth graders and their families free entrance to our National Parks and other public lands and waters.</FP>
  <FP>It is one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens of this Nation and stewards of this planet to protect these outdoor spaces of incomparable beauty and to ensure that this powerful inheritance is passed on to future generations. During National Wilderness Month, let us strengthen our connection with these natural treasures and ensure that the stories they tell and the resources they provide are resilient and everlasting in the years to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Wilderness Month. I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the protection of our precious national treasures.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than 10,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Although rare, pediatric cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children. As we invest in cutting-edge research and work to advance medical treatments to beat childhood cancer, each of us can help carry our vision of a cancer-free future forward. Each September, we remember those who lost their lives to cancer far too young and honor the courageous children who bring unwavering strength and optimism to their fight against cancer every single day, and we refocus our efforts on striving to cure cancer once and for all.</FP>
  <FP>Cancer affects children of all ages, generally without a known cause. Over the last half-century, as cancer research and treatment has advanced, the outlook for children with cancer has greatly improved. We have witnessed tremendous improvements in overall survival rates, and a larger number of long-term survivors now look forward to longer life expectancies. Unfortunately, many face chronic health challenges or complications after they beat their cancer. As a Nation, we must recognize that there is more we must do to better understand and treat pediatric cancer.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration continues to invest in the critical research we need to defeat this devastating disease. In 2014, I signed the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which established the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund and has already helped divert millions of dollars every year to advancing childhood cancer research. Through our Precision Medicine Initiative—a bold research effort to revolutionize our approach to treating diseases by personalizing treatment based on specific genetic characteristics—we are already making powerful discoveries for cancer patients and looking to transform the ways we treat many types of cancer. And earlier this year, I tasked Vice President Joe Biden with leading a new national effort to fight cancer. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force—a collaborative effort to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years—is working toward an ultimate goal of eliminating cancer as we know it.</FP>

  <FP>To give children with cancer the care they need and reduce the financial burden that falls on their families, we have worked to provide quality, affordable health care to all people. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped millions of Americans access medical care and enabled them to receive regular checkups, which can help detect cancer. Many children's cancer centers participate in clinical trials, which are partly responsible for much of the progress we have made in advancing treatment of childhood cancer; under the ACA, insurers can no longer drop or limit coverage because of participation in one of these trials. The ACA eliminated annual and lifetime limits on insurance coverage, and because the law prevents insurance companies from denying or limiting coverage for pre-existing conditions, children diagnosed with cancer now have a better chance at a healthy life.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, let us tell the stories of the brave children who battle cancer every day and thank the loved ones, health care professionals, and communities who lift them up. Let us renew our commitment to prevent, treat, and cure childhood cancer, and together ensure that all children can experience the full and healthy upbringing they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of childhood cancer.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Causing more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancers, ovarian cancer affects women of all ages and backgrounds. But the incidence of ovarian cancer, and its death rate, have fallen in recent years. Today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs, and it is of critical national importance that we accelerate this progress and keep reaching for prevention, treatment, and a cure. Each September, in honor of the women who have been taken by ovarian cancer and the brave individuals still fighting this disease, we reaffirm our commitment to carrying forward this important work.</FP>
  <FP>It is estimated that more than 22,000 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, and due to a lack of effective screening tests and early warning signs, many of these cases will be caught at an advanced stage—making the cancer more difficult to treat, with a lower chance for recovery. Ovarian cancer is more common among older women and those who have it in their family history, but because most women are diagnosed without being at high risk, it is crucial that all women consult with their health care providers when experiencing some of its symptoms, which include pressure, swelling, and abdominal pain. I encourage everyone to visit www.Cancer.gov/Ovarian to learn more about the signs and symptoms of this disease.</FP>

  <FP>Under the Affordable Care Act, annual and lifetime limits on insurance coverage have been eliminated, and critical preventive services like well-woman visits—which are now available without a copay or deductible—<PRTPAGE P="248"/>have been expanded for millions more women. The Act also prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition, including cancer, or from denying coverage due to a family history of cancer.</FP>
  <FP>Earlier this year, I announced a new national effort to cure cancer. Led by Vice President Joe Biden, the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force is promoting research efforts and breaking down barriers to progress to eliminate cancer as we know it. With the help of a nearly $1 billion initiative to jumpstart this work, we are harnessing the spirit of American innovation to identify new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. The Task Force builds on the important work that Federal agencies have already been doing throughout my time in office to fight ovarian cancer. The Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program is supporting high-impact, cutting-edge research where it is needed most and has helped push these research priorities forward. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has striven to raise awareness of the main types of gynecologic cancer, including ovarian cancer, and to encourage women to learn of warning signs and seek medical care.</FP>
  <FP>For the mothers, sisters, daughters, partners, and families who face the pain and heartache of ovarian cancer, we must make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, as we recognize those in the medical community who work tirelessly to provide treatment and care and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives to this disease, let us resolve to increase awareness of ovarian cancer and shape a cancer-free future.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.</FP>

A cancer-free future is within our <PRTPAGE P="249"/>grasp—with bold vision and daring optimism, we are pioneering medical breakthroughs in research and seeking to discover a cure for cancer in our time. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we remember all the men who lost their lives to this disease, and resolve to reach a tomorrow where prostate cancer is no longer a threat to our sons and grandsons.</FP>
  <FP>In 2016, approximately 180,000 men will be diagnosed, and 26,000 men will lose their battle with prostate cancer. Incredible advancements have paved the way for better prevention, detection, and treatment of this disease, and over the past two decades, the incidence of new cases and mortality rates for prostate cancer have been steadily declining. Men who are African American, over the age of 65, or have a family history of prostate cancer are at higher risk and should be aware of risk factors and symptoms. I encourage all men to talk to their health care providers about how prostate cancer can affect them, and to learn more by visiting www.Cancer.gov/Prostate or www.CDC.gov/Cancer/Prostate.</FP>
  <FP>The Affordable Care Act has ensured that more Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance, and it prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to someone simply because they have prostate cancer. The Act eliminates annual and lifetime limits on coverage and ensures individuals have the option to participate in clinical trials, which have proven helpful in advancing research of new treatment strategies and improving clinical care for men with prostate cancer.</FP>
  <FP>This year, I asked Vice President Joe Biden to lead our Nation in a new effort to end cancer as we know it. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force is striving to make a decade of advances in cancer prevention, treatment, and care in just 5 years through the collaboration of Federal agencies, jumpstarted by a proposed nearly $1 billion investment. Additionally, the Department of Veterans Affairs is helping to introduce a series of pilot programs that will accelerate clinical research and care for veterans with prostate cancer using cutting-edge biotechnologies—they are also working to increase precision oncology research and strengthen personalized medicine for the treatment of prostate cancer among veterans. These efforts build on the goals of our Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to deliver personalized care and apply medicine more efficiently and effectively based on genetics—and ultimately, to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer.</FP>
  <FP>This month, let us thank the countless researchers, medical professionals, and advocates who dedicate themselves to supporting survivors and beating cancer. Let us continue raising awareness of prostate cancer and renew our commitment to finding a cure once and for all.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.<PRTPAGE P="250"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Labor Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The strongest middle class the world has ever known was not built overnight. It was achieved by men and women who believed that living up to the promise of this Nation meant more than hoping for the best—it meant toiling in the day, working through the night, and proving that theirs was a future worth fighting for. On Labor Day, we celebrate the grit and resilience of America's workers and their families, and we recommit to reaching for a world in which they are afforded the rights and opportunities they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>America celebrated its first Labor Day in the late 19th century, when a group of industrial workers in New York joined in common purpose to celebrate their contributions to our country. Growing in numbers by the thousands, they went without their daily pay to march for their cause—setting in motion a labor movement that has inspired generations of Americans since. Clear-eyed and persistent, these hardworking union members, and those that followed in the path they forged, helped secure privileges we now take for granted—not only for themselves, but also for their friends and loved ones and neighbors. Their efforts brought about weekends and 40-hour workweeks, overtime pay and a minimum wage, and the collective bargaining rights that have empowered so many. Because of the battles they waged, our Nation benefits from health insurance and Medicare, Social Security, and other retirement programs. Their legacy is one we will never stop striving to uphold.</FP>
  <FP>When I took office, our country faced the worst recession many of us had ever seen. But through the determination of our resilient workforce—the best workers on the planet—we have been able to lay a stronger foundation for our economy. Our auto industry has emerged stronger than ever, and the manufacturing sector, on the decline during the Great Recession and in its aftermath, has added over 800,000 new jobs. American businesses have added 15.1 million jobs since 2010. We are now in the middle of the longest streak of overall job growth on record, and wage growth has accelerated.</FP>

  <FP>My priority since taking office has always been the well-being of the American people, and over the course of my Administration, I have taken steps to make sure everyone in our workforce is treated and compensated in ways that reflect the effort they put in. Whether by pursuing measures that can help ensure a fair day's pay for a hard day's work, updating occupational health and safety rules so that no one has to risk their life or health for their job, or working with State leaders to increase access to paid sick and family leave, we have made great strides on our journey to protecting <PRTPAGE P="251"/>and growing the middle class. We are working to increase and diversify apprenticeships as part of a job-driven skills agenda, and protect middle class savings by expanding retirement security. And by striving to close the gender pay gap, include more veterans and Americans with disabilities in our workforce, protect people who choose to organize a union in their workplaces, and prevent people from being denied opportunities because of who they are or who they love, we have moved closer to giving all our people an equal shot at making it in our global economy.</FP>
  <FP>On Labor Day, we are reminded that jobs are about more than a paycheck. They afford us the ability to take care of our family, friends, and neighbors; to save for that well-deserved retirement; to give back to our communities and the country we would do anything for. Jobs allow us to dream, to look toward the future, and to encourage our children to do the same. Though there is much more to do until all our men and women have the rights and respect they need to thrive in their workplaces, on this occasion, let us recommit to standing together and resolving to create change. If we do, I am confident we can reach new heights for ourselves, for our children, and for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 5, 2016, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Ensuring opportunity is within reach for everyone requires us to provide all our people with access to a world-class education. Higher education gives people a sense of who they are and sharpens how they see the world, and in our 21st-century economy, it is an investment that pays off—helping Americans work their way into the middle class. Across our country, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) have helped Hispanic students—many of whom are the first in their family to go to college—earn a college degree. This week, we reflect on how these important institutions have helped Hispanic students reach for their dreams, and we reaffirm our commitment to supporting them for generations to come.<PRTPAGE P="252"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>HSIs have given more Hispanics access to the resources and opportunities they need to compete in our economy. More than half of America's Hispanic undergraduates attend HSIs, which have played a critical role in increasing access to a college education and have worked to bolster enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. In the last several years, college enrollment among Hispanics hit a record high, and today, it continues to grow. Over the past two decades, the percentage of young Hispanics who have earned a college degree has increased significantly—but in that same time, disparities have persisted. HSIs are helping ensure more Hispanics have the opportunity to complete college, moving us closer to our goal of leading the world in higher education by 2020.</FP>
  <FP>Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in America, and we must keep striving to ensure they can pursue an exceptional education. My Administration has sought to improve educational outcomes and opportunities for every American, including Hispanics through the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. We have helped strengthen HSIs, which serve a higher proportion of low-income students than other institutions of higher education, by investing more than $1 billion in them over 10 years. Because college has never been more expensive, I have also taken steps to make it easier for more Americans to pay for higher education—steps that include expanding Pell Grants and offering tuition tax credits. And I am fighting for 2 years of free community college for any student willing to work for it, because no American should be priced out of a quality education.</FP>
  <FP>The contributions of Hispanics have shaped our national narrative, and it is crucial to our success that we empower more Hispanics and young people across our country to thrive. For generations, HSIs have helped Hispanics earn college degrees, seek meaningful careers, and aspire to be anything they want. At the heart of our Nation is the idea that no matter where you come from or what you look like, if you are willing to work hard, you can make it in America. By expanding opportunities for all, we can bring more people closer to reaching their piece of the American dream.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through September 18, 2016, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the many ways these institutions and their graduates contribute to our country.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On September 11, 2001, a group of small and hateful minds conspired to threaten the very fiber of our country, seeking to break the American spirit and destroy our way of life. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, Americans were struck with grief as devastation and senseless loss of innocent human life unfolded. In the empty shadow of the World Trade Center, the remains of the Pentagon, and a charred Pennsylvania field where courageous passengers saved countless lives, what emerged from the ashes of that day was not defeat—it was the heroism, compassion, and unity of the American people, which no act of terror or hate could ever take away. On September 11, we recall the true spirit of our Nation following these heinous attacks, and we resolve to enshrine the enduring compassion and love of our people forever in the heart of America.</FP>
  <FP>Fifteen years later, we pay tribute to the loss of nearly 3,000 lives, reflect on treasured memories of those we lost, and resolve to never forget that day, even as we look toward a brighter and more hopeful future. We draw inspiration from the survivors who still bear the scars—both seen and unseen—of that tragic day. We honor the valiance of our Nation's first responders, whose instinct was not to turn back to find safety for themselves, but to run toward untold danger. We show our gratitude to those young Americans of the 9/11 Generation, who until that day lived knowing only peace, but who have answered our country's call to serve under our flag to meet the threats of our time with bravery and distinction.</FP>
  <FP>In the years that have followed, with prayer and reflection, grace and faith, Americans have grieved together, held each other close, and looked out for one another. Though the void felt by those who lost a loved one on that day can never be filled, we can continue to heal the wounds inflicted by hatred by honoring the notion that, no matter our differences, we are forever united as one American family.</FP>
  <FP>As we mourn on this most solemn anniversary, let us also reflect on the freedom and tolerance that define this great Nation, and let us reaffirm our commitment to preserving those fundamental values for each generation of Americans to come.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 9 through Sunday, September 11, 2016, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world to participate in this commemoration.<PRTPAGE P="254"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World Suicide Prevention Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every year, too many people are taken from us by suicide. These tragedies tear at families and communities, leaving behind heartbroken loved ones who suffer immeasurably. World Suicide Prevention Day is a time to join with neighbors across the globe to reaffirm our commitment to preventing suicide. Here at home—thanks to dedicated crisis counselors on hotlines and in schools; clinicians and other health professionals in hospitals and mental health centers; faith leaders, teachers, friends, and family members who never give up on trying to make a meaningful difference—lives have been saved. Together, we can get people critical help when they are in crisis and raise awareness of the importance of preventing suicide in every community.</FP>
  <FP>It is critical that we recognize the connections that mental health conditions and substance use disorders have to suicide, as well as how other external factors, including harassment, bullying, and discrimination, can play a role. Suicide can touch any of us—regardless of age, gender, or race—and leave a lasting mark on communities. We must strive to build safe and supportive environments and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues that too often prevents people from seeking the care they need.</FP>
  <FP>No one should feel alone when facing these challenges—there is always hope, and always a helping hand. My Administration has served as a partner in this important effort through the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention—a public-private partnership through which the Federal Government has helped champion suicide prevention. All Americans can make a difference in this effort. Reach out to a friend, let them know you are there in moments of need, and encourage others to seek assistance—because empowering others to find the strength to ask for help and lifting up those who feel alone can save lives. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides immediate assistance for all Americans at 1-800-273-TALK, and I encourage you to call if you or someone you know is in need of help. Veterans, service members, and their loved ones can also call this number to reach the Veterans Crisis Line, and they can also send a text message to 838255.</FP>

  <FP>The Affordable Care Act provides the largest expansion of mental health coverage in a generation, and it has helped increase access to quality, affordable health insurance for all Americans. The Act prohibits insurers from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions like depression, expands mental health and substance use disorder parity policies to more than 60 million Americans, and requires that Health Insurance <PRTPAGE P="255"/>Marketplace plans cover mental health and substance use disorder services. Additionally, my Administration proposed a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health care. And because more than 20,000 Americans each year take their own lives with a firearm, we must do all we can to ensure people who need help get it and improve gun safety technology that can help prevent suicides.</FP>
  <FP>We also have to end the tragedy of suicide among our troops and our veterans. These American heroes give of themselves for our country, and they deserve the best from us in return—so long as any veteran is suffering or feels like they have nowhere to turn, we have more work to do. In 2014, I announced 19 Executive actions to improve mental health care for our veterans, members of our Armed Forces, and their loved ones. And last year, to build on these efforts, I signed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act to improve how we serve veterans with post-traumatic stress and other illnesses. By increasing peer support and outreach to service members transitioning to civilian life, this Act makes it easier for veterans to find the care they need when they need it.</FP>
  <FP>The theme of this year's World Suicide Prevention Day is “Connect. Communicate. Care.” These words provide a roadmap to reaching our universal goal of suicide prevention—encouraging all people to reach out to those who are suffering in silence, express when they are in need of help, and lift up those around them. On this day, we are reminded that help is available and that a brighter future lies ahead. Let us honor the souls we have lost too soon and vow to do everything in our power to prevent suicide.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10, 2016, as World Suicide Prevention Day. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise awareness of the mental health resources and support services available in their communities and encourage all those in need to seek the care and treatment necessary for a long and healthy life.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Every day, families and communities across the globe benefit from the too often unheralded wisdom and devotion of dedicated grandparents—women and men who blazed trails, broke down barriers, and shaped the world we know today. On National Grandparents Day, we honor America's grandparents as the backbone of our communities, and acknowledge the progress <PRTPAGE P="256"/>they forged so that their children and grandchildren could live out their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>In our grandmothers and grandfathers, we see a reflection of what is possible with hard work, grit, and determination. Their fight for inclusivity and opportunity for all can be seen in board rooms and courthouses across our country, and their efforts helped build the world's largest, most durable economy and strongest middle class. This enduring legacy spans generations and will empower innovators and leaders for years to come.</FP>
  <FP>Some grandparents sacrificed everything, leaving behind all they knew and loved to fight for freedom far from home, or to start a new life and give their families a chance at a brighter tomorrow in America. Millions of grandparents serve as primary caregivers, providing the discipline, guidance, and encouragement needed to thrive. And for so many Americans, our grandparents are our heroes, our confidantes, and our fiercest advocates. As connections to our past and inspirations for our future, grandparents made us who we are today and have paved a path we can aspire to follow.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we pause to reflect not only on the myriad ways our grandparents have enriched our lives with their selfless acts of compassion and kindness, but also on our responsibility to ensure they can retire as they deserve—with security and dignity. Let us recognize their lasting contributions to their families and communities, and let us express our gratitude for all they have made possible.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2016, as National Grandparents Day.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Fifteen years ago, nearly 3,000 innocent lives—men, women, and children who had been going about their normal routines—were taken from us, depriving families and loved ones of a lifetime of precious moments. But the acts of terror of September 11, 2001, sought to do more than hurt our people and bring down buildings: They sought to break our spirit and destroy the enduring values that unite us as Americans. In the years that followed, our capacity to love and to hope has guided us forward as we worked to rebuild, more sound and resilient than ever before. With the hearts of those <PRTPAGE P="257"/>we lost held faithfully in our memories, we reaffirm the unwavering optimism and everlasting strength that brought us together in our darkest hour, and we resolve to give of ourselves in service to others in that same spirit.</FP>
  <FP>The pain inflicted on our Nation on September 11 was felt by people of every race, background, and faith. Though many young Americans have grown up without knowing firsthand the horrors of that day, their lives have been shaped by it. They hear of the many acts of service that occurred—coworkers who led others to safety, passengers who stormed a cockpit, and first responders who charged directly into the fire. Many Americans did everything they could to help survivors, from volunteering their time to donating food, clothing, and blood. And many signed up to don our Nation's uniform to prove to the world that no act of terror could eclipse the strength or character of our country.</FP>
  <FP>United by a common creed, a commitment to lifting up our neighbors, and a belief that we are stronger when we stand by one another, we must find the courage to carry forward the legacy of those who stepped up in our time of need. By devoting ourselves to each other and recognizing that we are a part of something bigger than ourselves—just as heroic patriots did on September 11—we are paying tribute to their sacrifices. On this National Day of Service and Remembrance, we must ensure that darkness is no match for the light we shine by engaging in acts of service and charity. I invite all Americans to observe this day with compassionate and selfless deeds that embody the values that define our people, and to visit www.Serve.gov to find opportunities to give back to their communities.</FP>
  <FP>America endures in the tenacity of our survivors, and in the dedication of those who keep us safe. Today, we honor all who lost their lives in the heartbreaking attacks of September 11, and all who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in the years that followed. In memory of these beautiful souls, we vow to keep moving forward. Let us have confidence in the values that make us American, the liberties that make us a beacon to the world, and the unity we sustain every year on this anniversary. Above all, let us stand as strong as ever before and recognize that together, there is nothing we cannot overcome.</FP>
  <FP>By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as “Patriot Day,” and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized “National Day of Service and Remembrance.”</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our founding, our Nation has drawn strength from the diversity of our people. With faith and passion, a sturdy work ethic and profound devotion to family, Hispanics have helped carry forward our legacy as a vibrant beacon of opportunity for all. Whether their ancestors have been here for generations or they are among the newest members of our American family, they represent many countries and cultures, each adding their own distinct and dynamic perspective to our country's story. In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor the contributions Hispanics have made throughout our history, and we highlight an important part of the rich diversity that keeps our communities strong.</FP>
  <FP>Hispanic Americans have had a lasting impact on our history and have helped drive hard-won progress for all our people. They are the writers, singers, and musicians that enrich our arts and humanities; the innovative entrepreneurs steering our economy. They are the scientists and engineers revolutionizing our ways of life and making sweeping new discoveries; the advocates leading the way for social and political change. They are the brave men and women in uniform who commit themselves to defending our most cherished ideals at home and abroad. And their lasting achievements and devotion to our Nation exemplify the tenacity and perseverance embedded in our national character.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration stands firmly committed to opening doors of opportunity for all Americans and addressing issues of vital importance to the Hispanic community. The unemployment rate for the Hispanic community has dropped steadily since I took office, and we have worked to support <PRTPAGE P="260"/>the growth and development of Hispanic-owned businesses. Last year, Hispanic Americans saw the largest gains of any racial or ethnic group in median income and experienced among the greatest reductions in poverty. We have fought to make home ownership more affordable and to raise the Federal minimum wage—which would benefit more than 8 million Hispanic workers. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 4 million Hispanic non-elderly adults have gained access to quality, affordable health care, reducing the uninsured rate among Hispanics by more than a quarter. The high school graduation rate among Hispanic students is rising, and we have taken action to help more Hispanic students enroll in college. And by charting a new course in our relationship with Cuba, we are strengthening communication and bolstering relations between friends and family in both countries—reinforcing many ties to Latin America.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation's remarkable story began with immigration. Today, we must continue seeking to make the promise of our Nation real in the lives of all people, including for those who are Americans by every measure except for a piece of paper. Through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, hardworking young Dreamers—including many Hispanics—have been given more opportunities to reach for their highest aspirations. I remain deeply committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform, and my Administration will continue doing all that we can to carry forward our Nation's legacy as a melting pot of the world. Through the work of the White House Task Force on New Americans, we are striving to support the integration of immigrants and refugees into our communities. We will continue to welcome those fleeing persecution, including those from the Western Hemisphere, and we will keep working to make our immigration system fairer and smarter.</FP>
  <FP>This month, let us reflect on the countless ways in which Hispanics have contributed to our Nation's success, and let us reaffirm our commitment to expanding opportunity and building an ever brighter future for all. Let us embrace the diversity that strengthens us and continue striving to ensure the American dream is within reach for generations of Hispanics to come.</FP>
  <FP>To honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as “National Hispanic Heritage Month.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2016, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For centuries, courageous members of our Armed Forces have embodied the best of America with devotion and patriotism. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we pause to remember our servicemen and women who never returned home. The hardship experienced by prisoners of war and by the family members of those who have gone missing in action is unimaginable to most Americans; it is our country's solemn obligation to bring these heroes back to the land they served to defend, and to support the families who, each day, carry on without knowing the peace of being reunited with their loved ones.</FP>
  <FP>The United States does not leave anyone behind, and we do not forget those who remain missing. We will never stop working to bring home those who gave everything for their country, nor cease in our pursuit of the fullest possible accounting for all who are missing. We are working to fulfill this promise by strengthening communication with the families of those service members missing or taken prisoner. And as Commander in Chief, I am committed to living up to this responsibility.</FP>
  <FP>The men and women of our Armed Forces face unthinkable conditions and bear the painful cost of war. Theirs is a debt we can never fully repay, though we will continue striving to remain worthy of their sacrifice. In honor of those who have not yet come home, and the families who struggle with the fear of unknown fate, we renew our fierce commitment to our patriots in uniform and pledge to do everything we can to bring those missing or held prisoner home.</FP>
  <FP>On September 16, 2016, the stark black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; national cemeteries; and other locations across our country. We raise this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation to always remember the sacrifices made to defend our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16, 2016, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9496</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For generations, communities and families have relied on the waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and have told of their wonders. Throughout New England, the maritime trades, and especially fishing, have supported a vibrant way of life, with deep cultural roots and a strong connection to the health of the ocean and the bounty it provides. Over the past several decades, the Nation has made great strides in its stewardship of the ocean, but the ocean faces new threats from varied uses, climate change, and related impacts. Through exploration, we continue to make new discoveries and improve our understanding of ocean ecosystems. In these waters, the Atlantic Ocean meets the continental shelf in a region of great abundance and diversity as well as stark geological relief. The waters are home to many species of deep-sea corals, fish, whales and other marine mammals. Three submarine canyons and, beyond them, four undersea mountains lie in the waters approximately 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod. This area (the canyon and seamount area) includes unique ecological resources that have long been the subject of scientific interest.</FP>
  <FP>The canyon and seamount area, which will constitute the monument as set forth in this proclamation, is composed of two units, which showcase two distinct geological features that support vulnerable ecological communities. The Canyons Unit includes three underwater canyons—Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia—and covers approximately 941 square miles. The Seamounts Unit includes four seamounts—Bear, Mytilus, Physalia, and Retriever—and encompasses 3,972 square miles. The canyon and seamount area includes the waters and submerged lands within the coordinates included in the accompanying map. The canyon and seamount area contains objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government. These objects are the canyons and seamounts themselves, and the natural resources and ecosystems in and around them.</FP>
  <FP>The canyons start at the edge of the geological continental shelf and drop from 200 meters to thousands of meters deep. The seamounts are farther off shore, at the start of the New England Seamount chain, rising thousands of meters from the ocean floor. These canyons and seamounts are home to at least 54 species of deep-sea corals, which live at depths of at least 3,900 meters below the sea surface. The corals, together with other structure-forming fauna such as sponges and anemones, create a foundation for vibrant deep-sea ecosystems, providing food, spawning habitat, and shelter for an array of fish and invertebrate species. These habitats are extremely sensitive to disturbance from extractive activities.</FP>

  <FP>Because of the steep slopes of the canyons and seamounts, oceanographic currents that encounter them create localized eddies and result in upwelling. Currents lift nutrients, like nitrates and phosphates, critical to the growth of phytoplankton from the deep to sunlit surface waters. These nutrients fuel an eruption of phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the <PRTPAGE P="263"/>base of the food chain. Aggregations of plankton draw large schools of small fish and then larger animals that prey on these fish, such as whales, sharks, tunas, and seabirds. Together the geology, currents, and productivity create diverse and vibrant ecosystems.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">The Canyons</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>Canyons cut deep into the geological continental shelf and slope throughout the mid-Atlantic and New England regions. They are susceptible to active erosion and powerful ocean currents that transport sediments and organic carbon from the shelf through the canyons to the deep ocean floor. In Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia canyons, the hard canyon walls provide habitats for sponges, corals, and other invertebrates that filter food from the water to flourish, and for larger species including squid, octopus, skates, flounders, and crabs. Major oceanographic features, such as currents, temperature gradients, eddies, and fronts, occur on a large scale and influence the distribution patterns of such highly migratory oceanic species as tuna, billfish, and sharks. They provide feeding grounds for these and many other marine species.</FP>
  <FP>Toothed whales, such as the endangered sperm whale, and many species of beaked whales are strongly attracted to the environments created by submarine canyons. Surveys of the area show significantly higher numbers of beaked whales present in canyon regions than in non-canyon shelf-edge regions. Endangered sperm whales, iconic in the region due to the historic importance of the species to New England's whaling communities, preferentially inhabit the U.S. Atlantic continental margin. Two additional species of endangered whales (fin whales and sei whales) have also been observed in the canyon and seamount area.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">The Seamounts</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>The New England Seamount Chain was formed as the Earth's crust passed over a stationary hot spot that pushed magma up through the seafloor, and is now composed of more than 30 extinct undersea volcanoes, running like a curved spine from the southern side of Georges Bank to midway across the western Atlantic Ocean. Many of them have characteristic flat tops that were created by erosion by ocean waves and subsidence as the magma cooled. Four of these seamounts—Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus—are in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. Bear Seamount is approximately 100 million years old and the largest of the four; it rises approximately 2,500 meters from the seafloor to within 1,000 meters of the sea surface. Its summit is over 12 miles in diameter. The three smaller seamounts reach to within 2,000 meters of the surface. All four of these seamounts have steep and complex topography that interrupts existing currents, providing a constant supply of plankton and nutrients to the animals that inhabit their sides. They also cause upwelling of nutrient-rich waters toward the ocean surface.</FP>

  <FP>Geographically isolated from the continental platform, these seamounts support highly diverse ecological communities with deep-sea corals that are hundreds or thousands of years old and a wide array of other benthic marine organisms not found on the surrounding deep-sea floor. They provide shelter from predators, increased food, nurseries, and spawning areas. The New England seamounts have many rare and endemic species, several of which are new to science and are not known to live anywhere else on Earth.<PRTPAGE P="264"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">The Ecosystem</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>The submarine canyons and seamounts create dynamic currents and eddies that enhance biological productivity and provide feeding grounds for seabirds; pelagic species, including whales, dolphins, and turtles; and highly migratory fish, such as tunas, billfish, and sharks. More than ten species of shark, including great white sharks, are known to utilize the feeding grounds of the canyon and seamount area. Additionally, surveys of leatherback and loggerhead turtles in the area have revealed increased numbers above and immediately adjacent to the canyons and Bear Seamount.</FP>
  <FP>Marine birds concentrate in upwelling areas near the canyons and seamounts. Several species of gulls, shearwaters, storm petrels, gannets, skuas, and terns, among others, are regularly observed in the region, sometimes in large aggregations. Recent analysis of geolocation data found that Maine's vulnerable Atlantic puffin frequents the canyon and seamount area between September and March, indicating a previously unknown wintering habitat for those birds.</FP>
  <FP>These canyons and seamounts, and the ecosystem they compose, have long been of intense scientific interest. Scientists from government and academic oceanographic institutions have studied the canyons and seamounts using research vessels, submarines, and remotely operated underwater vehicles for important deep-sea expeditions that have yielded new information about living marine resources. Much remains to be discovered about these unique, isolated environments and their geological, ecological, and biological resources.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, the waters and submerged lands in and around the deep-sea canyons Oceanographer, Lydonia, and Gilbert, and the seamounts Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus, contain objects of scientific and historic interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government;</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9497</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Tasked with the awesome responsibility of building a Government to endure for generations to come, a band of dedicated patriots gathered in Philadelphia in 1787, seeking to build a more stable and permanent framework for a nascent democracy. Passionate debates and intense negotiation gave way to lasting compromise, and a document emerged that became the bedrock of America. Signed on September 17, the Constitution of the United States has steered our country through ever-changing times. It guides us as leaders on the world stage and safeguards the fundamental rights of our citizens. And it guarantees that the greatness of our Nation never depends on any one person—it requires the full and active participation of an engaged and vibrant citizenry.</FP>
  <FP>The vision of self-government laid out in our Constitution is dependent on Americans doing the hard and sometimes frustrating—yet always essential—work of citizenship. Being a citizen is a responsibility that challenges each of us to stay informed, to speak out when something is not right or not just, and to come together to shape the course our country will take. Citizenship is a commitment, calling on us to stand up for what we believe in and to exercise our rights to protect the rights of others. The Bill of Rights and other amendments added in the decades that followed have paved the way for progress, and they embody a truth held since our founding: the simple but powerful idea that people who love their country can change it for the better.</FP>
  <FP>America is more than a piece of land—it is an idea, a place where we can contribute our talents, fulfill our ambitions, and be part of something bigger than ourselves. Each year on Citizenship Day, we celebrate our newest citizens who raise their hands and swear a sacred oath to join our American family. The journey they have taken reminds us that immigration is our origin story. For centuries, immigrants have brought diverse beliefs, cultures, languages, and traditions to our country, and they have pledged to uphold the ideals expressed in our founding documents. They come from all around the world, mustering faith that in America, they can build a better life and give their children something more. That is why I was proud to create the White House Task Force on New Americans, which is helping to build welcoming communities around our country and enhance civic, economic, and linguistic integration for immigrants and refugees. Through the Task Force, Federal agencies and local communities are working together to raise awareness about the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of citizenship—and to give immigrants and refugees the tools they need to succeed.</FP>

  <FP>As a Nation of immigrants, our legacy is rooted in their success. Their contributions help us live up to our founding principles. With pride in our diverse heritage and in our common creed, we affirm our dedication to the values enshrined in our Constitution. We, the people, must forever breathe <PRTPAGE P="271"/>life into the words of this precious document, and together ensure that its principles endure for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,” and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as “Constitution Week.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2016, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2016, as Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to conduct ceremonies and programs that bring together community members to reflect on the importance of active citizenship, recognize the enduring strength of our Constitution, and reaffirm our commitment to the rights and obligations of citizenship in this great Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>For generations, farmers and ranchers have formed the backbone of our economy and shaped the course of our Nation. They have served as critical stewards of our environment and natural resources. Toiling day in and day out in rural communities across our country, their dedication and dogged work ethic provide us with food, fuel, and other necessities, sustaining our people and our communities. Throughout National Farm Safety and Health Week, we honor their significant contributions by reaffirming our commitment to bolstering programs and practices that promote health and safety on America's farms.</FP>

  <FP>Millions of farmers and their families face a variety of unsafe conditions when they wake up for work each morning. Extreme weather, and exposure to livestock or hazardous chemicals can pose threats to their safety. Much of their work takes place in dangerous environments and with potentially harmful equipment, such as wells, silos, and grain bins. And putting in long hours of physical labor can also cause illness or injury. Our farmers and ranchers are exposed to too many of these dangers, and we must ensure they are equipped with the tools, trainings, and resources they need to take proper precautions and safety measures in their workplaces.<PRTPAGE P="272"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>To reduce work-related accidents and deaths among farming communities, my Administration has encouraged regular participation in health and safety programs. Increasing awareness of proper procedures is crucial, and farmers and farmworkers can improve their safety practices by correctly handling materials and inspecting machinery, paying careful attention to instructions and labels on products and equipment, and practicing and communicating plans for emergency response. Because many farms and ranches are family businesses, we have partnered with people across our country to help formalize youth farm safety education to improve farm safety for children.</FP>
  <FP>The best farmers in the world have enriched our Nation and driven our agriculture sector forward; it is our shared duty to ensure their health and safety, because we all have a stake in the well-being of those who provide us with food and energy. By maintaining safe work environments and taking steps to practice caution on our farms, we can minimize risks and increase productivity in one of the greatest and most essential industries in America.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through September 24, 2016, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon the agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services that serve America's agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to honor our agricultural heritage and express appreciation to our farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers for their contributions to our Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Each year, more Americans die from drug overdoses than in traffic accidents, and more than three out of five of these deaths involve an opioid. Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids, including prescription opioid pain relievers, heroin, and fentanyl, has nearly quadrupled. Many people who die from an overdose struggle with an opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder, and unfortunately misconceptions surrounding these disorders have contributed to harmful stigmas that prevent individuals from seeking evidence-based treatment. During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we pause to remember all those we have lost to opioid use disorder, we stand with the courageous <PRTPAGE P="273"/>individuals in recovery, and we recognize the importance of raising awareness of this epidemic.</FP>
  <FP>Opioid use disorder, or addiction to prescription opioids or heroin, is a disease that touches too many of our communities—big and small, urban and rural—and devastates families, all while straining the capacity of law enforcement and the health care system. States and localities across our country, in collaboration with Federal and national partners, are working together to address this issue through innovative partnerships between public safety and public health professionals. The Federal Government is bolstering efforts to expand treatment and opioid abuse prevention activities, and we are working alongside law enforcement to help get more people into treatment instead of jail.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is steadfast in its commitment to reduce overdose deaths and get more Americans the help they need. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to provide $1.1 billion to expand access to treatment services for opioid use disorder. These new investments would build on the steps we have already taken to expand overdose prevention strategies, and increase access to naloxone—the overdose reversal drug that first responders and community members are using to save lives. We are also working to improve opioid prescribing practices and support targeted enforcement activities. Although Federal agencies will continue using all available tools to address opioid use disorder and overdose, the Congress must act quickly to help more individuals get the treatment they need—because the longer we go without congressional action on this funding, the more opportunities we miss to save lives.</FP>
  <FP>Too often, we expect people struggling with substance use disorders to self-diagnose and seek treatment. And although we have made great strides in helping more Americans access care, far too many still lack appropriate, evidence-based treatment. This week, we reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness about this disease and supporting prevention and treatment programs. Let us ensure everyone with an opioid use disorder can embark on the road to recovery, and together, let us begin to turn the tide of this epidemic.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through September 24, 2016, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Hunting and fishing have endured as cherished traditions for generations. Whether for sport, sustenance, or both, these activities provide opportunities for Americans to connect with those around them—from tribal elders sharing sacred practices to parents spending time outdoors with their children. On this day, as we celebrate America's hunters and fishers for the ways in which they have strengthened our communities, we also honor their call to serve as good stewards of our lands and waters.</FP>
  <FP>Anglers and hunters were some of the earliest conservation leaders, and they remain key partners in safeguarding the important recreational opportunities provided by our unparalleled natural spaces. Caring for our environment is critical for supporting hunting and fishing, and today we recognize the growing urgency of conserving our Nation's lands, waters, and ecosystems so that more Americans can enjoy all they have to offer. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has helped create new opportunities for hunting and fishing.</FP>
  <FP>Outdoor areas across America are renowned for their beauty and for the wealth of recreational activities they support. To secure this legacy, my Administration has protected more acres of public lands and waters than any other in our Nation's history—and this past summer, I established the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, which preserves access to hunting. And at national wildlife refuges, in forests, and on public and private lands throughout our country, we have expanded opportunities for Americans to hunt, fish, and reconnect with nature.</FP>
  <FP>Hunting and fishing strengthen local economies, provide sustenance, and help Americans experience the outdoors. By enriching our communities and bringing people together, hunters and anglers have carried forward traditions dating back to long before our Nation's founding. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we recognize the majestic landscapes that make these activities possible for Americans around our country. As we acknowledge the important cultural heritage surrounding hunting and fishing, let us vow to protect our Nation's remarkable outdoor spaces for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2016, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. I invite all Americans to observe this day with appropriate activities in our great outdoors.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Public Lands Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Nothing can truly capture the beauty and majesty of America's expansive landscapes and wide-open acres. On National Public Lands Day, Americans from coast-to-coast celebrate these spaces by participating in the largest single-day volunteer effort to restore and enhance the lands we all enjoy. Volunteers will remove litter and invasive plant species, blaze new trails and maintain existing ones, and plant seeds that will grow in the years to come—taking full advantage of the chance to give back to the lands that have given us all so much.</FP>
  <FP>Our public lands reflect our shared history, and enable us to connect to each other and to something bigger than ourselves. National Parks, forests, wildlife refuges, conservation lands, and marine sanctuaries not only strengthen our economy through tourism and provide endless recreational and educational opportunities, but are also home to important biodiversity and rich ecosystems. I am proud that my Administration has protected hundreds of millions of acres of these vital lands and waters—more than any Administration in history. Through the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, we have also promoted innovative, community-level efforts to conserve outdoor spaces and reconnect Americans with nature. And through the 21st Century Conservation Corps, we have worked to inspire millions of young adults and veterans to engage in hands-on service in the great outdoors.</FP>
  <FP>On National Public Lands Day, all federally managed public lands and waters are offering free admission so Americans can observe this day not just by caring for these spaces, but by enjoying their vast wonders. To ensure more young people can discover our great outdoors, my “Every Kid in a Park” initiative is again giving fourth grade students and their families free access to all National Parks and other Federal lands for an entire year. And as the National Park Service celebrates 100 years of preserving and protecting these important spaces, we are encouraging more Americans to “Find Your Park” and explore the extraordinary parks and public lands in their communities.</FP>
  <FP>As stewards of our environment and caretakers of these public lands, we must build on our legacy of conservation. Climate change poses the single biggest threat to our natural resources. Across our country, we are experiencing stronger storms, harsher droughts, increased flooding, and longer wildfire seasons that put these public spaces at risk—which is why any effort to fully combat climate change must include protecting our land, water, and wildlife. Let us rededicate ourselves to this critical work and continue looking after these natural treasures and protecting our historic and cultural heritage for generations to come.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2016, as National Public Lands Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our Nation's founding, in peace and in war, the values that define our brave men and women in uniform have remained constant: honor, courage, and selflessness. From the deafening sounds of combat to the silence of the sacred hills at Arlington, we remember the countless sacrifices our service members make to preserve the freedoms we too often take for granted. No one understands the true price of these freedoms like our Gold Star families, whose humility, even in times of grief, represents the best of our country. Today, we recognize their sacrifices by listening to their stories, sharing in their pain and pride, and pledging to do all we can to honor them and the loved ones they hold close in their hearts.</FP>
  <FP>Through unspeakable sorrow, our Gold Star families suffer from loss that can never be restored—pain that can never truly be healed. It is because of their selfless character and unfailing grace that Americans can come home each day, gather with family and friends, and live in peace and security. And though the debt our fallen soldiers and their families pay is one we can never fully pay back, we must continue to support our veterans when they come home and stand by our military families who endure unthinkable loss. We must maintain the sacred covenant we share with our veterans by ensuring they have the care and benefits they deserve, and as citizens, we must all work to lift each other up in a manner that is worthy of those who laid down their lives to protect the land and freedoms we cherish.</FP>
  <FP>Less than one percent of our Nation wear the uniform, but all of us have an obligation to acknowledge the losses endured by Gold Star Mothers and Families and to fill the painful absence of their loved ones with our profound gratitude. We must strive to support these families—not just with words, but with actions—by being there every day for the parents, spouses, and children who feel the weight of their loss. On this day of remembrance, may we carry forward the work of those who gave their last full measure of devotion and vow to keep their memories burning bright in our hearts. And may we lift up their families, who have steadfastly supported their mission through immeasurable heartbreak, by remaining a Nation worthy of their sacrifice.</FP>

  <FP>The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1985 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as “Gold Star Mother's Day.”<PRTPAGE P="277"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Voter Registration Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>One of the most fundamental and sacred rights of any democracy is the right to vote; in order for our government to function effectively and respond to the needs of our people, all citizens can and must play a role in shaping it. Each year on National Voter Registration Day, we reaffirm the strong sense of civic pride among our people and encourage friends, family members, and neighbors to get involved in civic life by registering to vote.</FP>
  <FP>Democracy is not a spectator sport. If we are serious about improving our country and ensuring our government reflects our values, we cannot afford to sit out on Election Day. Unfortunately, among those who are eligible to vote, too many choose not to—far too many people disenfranchise themselves by not getting involved. When we do not take full advantage of the right to vote, we not only give away our voice; our power; our ability to shape the future of the country we love—we also do a disservice to the generations of Americans before us who risked everything, including their lives, to protect this fundamental aspect of our Republic.</FP>
  <FP>Our brand of democracy is hard, and it requires our citizens to be able to fully participate in a smooth and effective way. Through a bipartisan, independent commission dedicated to improving the voting process, we are working to ensure our democracy and our elections function the way they are supposed to. Whether through strengthening mechanisms that allow more people to vote—such as online registration—or going door-to-door to register voters in our communities, we must make registering to vote easier. By protecting and expanding this right, we can ensure this grand experiment in self-government works for more Americans. For more information on how to register to vote, visit www.VOTE.USA.gov.</FP>

  <FP>It is easy to feel frustrated when the pace of change is slow—and to lose hope in the political process as a result. But we cannot give in to that cynicism. Heroic things happen when people get involved. Our government is <PRTPAGE P="278"/>only as strong as what we put into it, and it is only reflective of the will of our citizenry when we exercise our right to vote. Today, as we once again celebrate National Voter Registration Day, let us carry forward the tradition of promoting voter registration and civic engagement, recommit to exercising one of the most precious of our democratic rights, and remember that the task of perfecting our Union belongs to us all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 27, 2016, as National Voter Registration Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Arts and Humanities Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Throughout history, the arts and humanities have been at the forefront of progress. In diverse mediums and methods—whether through the themes of a novel, the movement of a dancer, or a monologue on a stage—the arts enrich our souls, inspire us to chase our dreams, and challenge us to see things through a different lens. During National Arts and Humanities Month, we celebrate the important role the arts and humanities have played in shaping the American narrative.</FP>
  <FP>Our achievements as a society and a culture go hand-in-hand. The arts embody who we are as a people and have long helped drive the success of our country. They provoke thought and encourage our citizenry to reach new heights in creativity and innovation; they lift up our identities, connecting what is most profound within us to our collective human experiences.</FP>
  <FP>In seeking to break down barriers and challenge our assumptions, we must continue promoting and prioritizing the arts and humanities, especially for our young people. In many ways, the arts and humanities reflect our national soul. They are central to who we are as Americans—as dreamers and storytellers, creators and visionaries. By investing in the arts, we can chart a course for the future in which the threads of our common humanity are bound together with creative empathy and openness. When we engage with the arts, we instill principles that, at their core, make us truer to ourselves.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we acknowledge all those who have proudly and passionately dedicated their lives to these diverse, beautiful, and often challenging forms of expression. In our increasingly global economy, we recognize the power of the arts and humanities to connect people around the world. Be it through the pen of a poet, the voice of a singer, or the canvas of a painter, let us continue to harness the unparalleled ways the arts and humanities bring people together.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and the humanities in America.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Child Health Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Today's youth will shape our Nation's narrative and drive our progress, and it is our duty to ensure our young people are given every opportunity to live full, healthy lives. Securing a bright future for America's daughters and sons requires us to continue expanding access to quality health care and working to foster cleaner, safer, and more supportive environments. On Child Health Day, we renew our strong commitment to protecting and empowering our children by giving them the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to grow into healthy and productive adults.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration has made children's health a top priority throughout the past 8 years. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative, we have worked to bring parents, schools, and communities together to reduce childhood obesity by increasing access to affordable and nutritious food, and by encouraging physical activity early on in life. Parents and guardians serve as role models when it comes to forming healthy habits, and they can help their children learn to make smart choices that will shape their lifestyles for years to come.</FP>
  <FP>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no child can be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and millions of young people are able to remain on a parent's insurance plan until age 26. Cancer touches the lives of millions of Americans, and pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease among children. Earlier this year, I called on Vice President Joe Biden to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force—a collaborative effort that is striving to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years and is dedicated to ending cancer as we know it.</FP>
  <FP>Supporting our children's emotional and mental health is just as critical as protecting their physical health. Bullying touches the lives of young people across our country and can affect their mental health, and we are committed to providing parents and schools with the support they need to address harassment—because no child should be hurt, and no child should feel ashamed because of who they are.</FP>
  <FP>As we face growing environmental threats, it is our responsibility to combat climate change and protect our planet for future generations. That is why we have taken concrete steps to address carbon pollution and advocate for cleaner energy options. Through the Paris Climate Agreement, we are joining with nearly 200 countries to adopt ambitious measures that will reduce carbon pollution across the globe. By taking unprecedented action to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, we are striving to reduce the harmful effects that climate change can have on our children, including the potential for higher incidence of asthma attacks, and other health problems exacerbated by dirty air.</FP>

  <FP>This Child Health Day, we are reminded that the well-being of America's children is in our hands and that it is our responsibility to keep building a society that will allow them to thrive. Let us reaffirm our belief in the <PRTPAGE P="281"/>notion that all children should be able to live a healthy and happy life—no matter where they come from or what they look like—and let us continue reaching for a future where all our children are limited by nothing but the size of their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 3, 2016, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, educators, health professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and all levels of government to help ensure America's children are healthy.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every year, too many Americans are touched by the pain and hardship caused by breast cancer—a disease that, among women, is not only one of the most common cancers, but also one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all those who lost their lives to breast cancer, and we recognize the courageous survivors who are still fighting it. For these individuals, and for their loved ones who give their unwavering support during the most trying times, we recommit ourselves to the essential and necessary work of forging a future free from cancer in all its forms.</FP>
  <FP>Hundreds of thousands of Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and tens of thousands will lose their battle with this disease. Although both women and men can have breast cancer, women are at higher risk. Women with a family history of breast cancer, or those who are older or obese, are also more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. I encourage all women to find out if they are at increased risk and to learn more about recommended screenings by speaking with their health care providers and by visiting www.Cancer.gov/Breast.</FP>

  <FP>Early detection and treatment can save lives. Since I took office, I have worked to make quality, affordable health care a reality for more Americans. The Affordable Care Act has given millions of women expanded access to preventive services, including screening tests such as mammograms, <PRTPAGE P="282"/>with no out-of-pocket costs. Women can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a family history of breast cancer, and lifetime and annual limits on essential health benefits have been eliminated.</FP>
  <FP>Critical research efforts over time have yielded great progress in how we diagnose and treat breast cancer, which has produced a steady increase in survival rates for those suffering from this disease—and it is crucial that we keep building on these successes. This year, the National Cancer Institute launched the largest study of its kind to investigate the role of genetic and biological factors in breast cancer risk among African American women, who have a higher risk of dying from breast cancer. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force, also launched this year, is a new national effort striving to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years. And through the Precision Medicine Initiative—a bold research effort aimed at delivering disease prevention and treatment based on an individual's unique traits and genetic information—we are pursuing new oncology-focused efforts to advance personalized care through targeted cancer therapies.</FP>
  <FP>This month, with bold pink ribbons displayed proudly across America, we stand in solidarity with breast cancer survivors and reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness of this disease and to advancing research efforts. Let us thank the countless advocates, medical professionals, researchers, and caregivers who dedicate their lives to fighting for a world without breast cancer, and together, let us carry out our mission to cure cancer once and for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Technology plays an increasingly significant role in our daily lives. The rise of the Internet has brought incredible opportunity and new ways of innovating and enhancing our way of life—but with great potential also comes heightened risk to our data. Keeping cyberspace secure is a matter of national security, and in order to ensure we can reap the benefits and <PRTPAGE P="283"/>utility of technology while minimizing the dangers and threats it presents, we must continue to make cybersecurity a top priority. Throughout National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we recognize the role that individuals can play in enhancing cybersecurity, and we join to raise awareness of the importance of securing our information against cyber threats.</FP>
  <FP>To build on the cybersecurity efforts already underway, my Administration introduced the Cybersecurity National Action Plan earlier this year to address short-term and long-term challenges when it comes to cybersecurity. We have proposed increasing the budget for cybersecurity by more than one-third and establishing an Information Technology Modernization Fund to help retire, replace, and modernize our costly information technology legacy systems. We are also striving to invest in cybersecurity education, reform the way Government manages and responds to large-scale cyber threats, and update obsolete Federal IT systems that are vulnerable to attack.</FP>
  <FP>To meet these goals, we created the position of the first-ever Federal Chief Information Security Officer to help drive cybersecurity policy, planning, and implementation across the Federal Government. We also established the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity to recommend actions that can be taken over the next decade to strengthen cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors while protecting privacy. This Commission will maintain public safety and economic and national security, foster discovery and development of new technical solutions, and bolster partnerships between governments and the private sector in an effort to promote best cybersecurity practices.</FP>
  <FP>Cyber threats not only pose a danger to our national security, but also have the potential to harm our financial security and undermine the privacy of millions of Americans. An important part of enhancing cybersecurity involves empowering more Americans to help themselves take proper precautions online and in their financial transactions; cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and everyone can do their part to make smart, safe choices. The Federal Government is also doing our part through the BuySecure Initiative, which has issued more than three million more secure credit cards for Government purchases. We are also working to help give Americans earlier warning of identity crimes with free access to credit scores through their existing consumer accounts.</FP>
  <FP>Through the Department of Homeland Security's “Stop.Think.Connect.” campaign, we are aiming to increase awareness of the simple steps people can take to strengthen their cybersecurity. The National Cyber Security Alliance, in partnership with the private sector and non-profit organizations, recently launched the “Lock Down Your Login” campaign to empower Americans to take control of their online accounts and add an extra layer of security beyond just using passwords. I encourage every American to take this important step and to visit www.LockDownYourLogin.com to learn more.</FP>

  <FP>Keeping America safe requires us to bolster our security online. This month, we renew our commitment to ensuring our information is more secure, our data is safer, and our families and businesses are more protected than ever before. If we work toward this goal—as individuals and as a Nation—together we can realize our full potential in the digital age.<PRTPAGE P="284"/>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Americans with disabilities are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as any other citizen—including the right to dignity and respect in the workplace. Too often in our Nation's history, individuals with disabilities have been eager to work but could not find a job, facing red tape, discrimination, or employers who assumed that disabled meant unable and refused to hire them. This month, we recognize the significant progress our country has made for those living with disabilities, and we honor the lasting contributions and diverse skills they bring to our workforce.</FP>
  <FP>As a country, we must acknowledge that despite the great strides we have made in the 26 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act—a groundbreaking civil rights law aimed at eliminating discrimination and assuring equality for people with disabilities—we still have far to go to raise awareness of discriminatory obstacles that individuals with disabilities encounter in employment. Today, the labor force participation rate for Americans with disabilities is less than one-third the rate of those without a disability, and the unemployment rate is more than twice as high for individuals with disabilities. To break down more of these barriers, we must expand access to the resources and training necessary for Americans with disabilities to succeed in the workplace.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to upholding our Nation's promise of equal opportunity for all and advancing employment for people with disabilities in every community. I am proud that the Federal Government is leading by example as a model employer, now employing more Americans with disabilities than at any time in the last 30 years. Last year, the White House hosted a Summit on Disability and Employment to share resources for employers to hire more individuals with disabilities and effective strategies for recruitment, retention, hiring, and promotion of these employees. Two years ago, through updates to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, we took action to increase the representation of workers with disabilities in the Federal contractor workforce. In 2014, I signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to help the Departments of Labor and Education build <PRTPAGE P="285"/>initiatives that advance employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities—and earlier this summer, we issued new regulations to provide greater and more inclusive career development and training opportunities for anyone facing barriers to employment.</FP>
  <FP>This year's National Disability Employment Awareness Month theme focuses on the importance of inclusion, especially when it comes to business, opportunity, and innovation. When we diversify our workforce we create opportunities for growth and improvement—not just for those with disabilities, but for everyone. This month, let us continue striving to forge a future where workplaces are more inclusive and where employees are more accepted for who they are. And because we know that our country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, let us keep working to ensure no one is left behind or unable to pursue their dreams because of a disability.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to embrace the talents and skills that individuals with disabilities bring to our workplaces and communities and to promote the right to equal employment opportunity for all people.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The physical and emotional scars of domestic violence can cast a long shadow. Too many individuals, regardless of age, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, circumstance, or race, face the pain and fear of domestic violence. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we shine a light on this violation of the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse, pledge to ensure every victim of domestic violence knows they are not alone, and foster supportive communities that help survivors seek justice and enjoy full and healthy lives.</FP>

  <FP>Over the past two decades, rates of domestic violence against females have dropped by nearly three-quarters—but there is still much work to do to build on the progress we have made. Nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have suffered from domestic violence by an intimate partner. All people deserve to feel safe with loved ones, and my Administration is committed to eliminating this scourge and supporting survivors' healing—and we must ensure that survivors and their families have access to the resources, care, and support they need to do so.<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>My Administration is dedicated to ensuring that all people feel safe in all aspects of their lives, which is why I proposed significant funding for responding to domestic violence in my most recent budget proposal. We have also championed legislative action like the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, and the Affordable Care Act—which ensures that most health plans cover domestic violence screening and counseling services at no additional cost. And the Violence Against Women Act, which was reauthorized in 2013, has enhanced and expanded protections to Native Americans, immigrants, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and victims who reside in public housing.</FP>
  <FP>This is progress we must continue to invest in and carry forward. Earlier this year, I announced a series of commonsense steps my Administration is taking to reduce gun violence, including work to renew our domestic violence outreach efforts. Building on the work of our Police Data Initiative, the White House is promoting smart approaches to collecting data on domestic violence offenses that balance transparency and accountability with victim safety and privacy. And victim safety should also be a priority in the workplace—a truth that extends to the Federal Government. That is why I directed all Federal agencies to adopt domestic violence workplace policies and encouraged employers to do the same.</FP>
  <FP>Our agencies have taken many critical actions to advance this cause. For example, the Department of Justice has invested millions of dollars in new initiatives to prevent domestic violence homicides, urge law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent gender bias when responding to domestic violence and sexual assault, and expand services to underserved victims. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued guidance to prevent housing discrimination against survivors of domestic violence.</FP>
  <FP>Vice President Joe Biden's leadership has helped guide our progress and worked to change our national culture—which too often tolerates and condones domestic violence. We are challenging harmful stereotypes associated with victims of domestic violence and striving to bring the practice of victim-blaming to an end. We must continue to recognize survivors who experience disproportionate rates of domestic violence, and who have been placed at the margins for generations, including women of color, Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, immigrants, and older adults. Along these lines, we also joined with Canada and Mexico to create the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls, working together to enhance responses to violent crimes against indigenous women and girls in North America.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation's character is tested whenever this injustice is tolerated. When anyone is targeted by someone they place their trust in, we have a responsibility to speak up. We all have a role to play in building a bright and safe future for each other and for future generations. This month, we recommit to standing with survivors of domestic violence and to doing our utmost to extend hope and healing to all who need it. If you or someone you know needs assistance, I encourage you to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which recently engaged in its 4 millionth conversation with victims and survivors of domestic violence, by calling 1-800-799-SAFE, or visiting www.TheHotline.org.<PRTPAGE P="287"/>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Energy Action Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The sustainability of our country and our world in the 21st century rests on our ability to address our shared energy challenges and to encourage diverse, clean, and efficient energy production. During National Energy Action Month, we rededicate ourselves to securing a more prosperous and energy-independent future. As climate change continues to threaten our planet, we must join together to reduce our carbon emissions, protect our environment, and leave behind a cleaner and more resilient world for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>Today, America is less reliant on foreign oil than at any point in the previous four decades. To build on this progress, we are implementing new fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles that are projected to significantly reduce diesel consumption. We are also increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances and modernizing our energy infrastructure as we experience a rapid transformation in the way power is generated and used across our country.</FP>
  <FP>To ensure our energy security for generations, the United States is partnering with Canada and Mexico to pursue regional energy security and combat climate change. Earlier this year at the North American Leaders Summit, we set an historic goal of achieving 50 percent clean power generation across our continent by 2025. These efforts will bolster a transition to clean energy sources that increase economic competitiveness and strengthen growing industries while supporting hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Our solar industry is creating jobs 12 times faster than the rest of the economy, and wind generation now supports tens of thousands of American jobs. Additionally, we are working to diversify our energy portfolio to include sources of zero emissions power like nuclear and hydropower; expand our supply of affordable, reliable, and efficient energy sources; and make it easier for every American to access cleaner forms of energy.</FP>

  <FP>In response to the devastating consequences of our changing climate, we are embracing our responsibility to achieve a low-carbon future. To do our <PRTPAGE P="288"/>part, we are on track to reach the 2020 emissions reductions goals I set when I first took office, and we are pursuing even greater cuts for 2025. Last year, we joined nearly 200 countries for the announcement of the most ambitious climate agreement in history, and in September we formally joined the Paris Agreement with China. As we embolden the world to take steps that will dramatically reduce global carbon pollution, we are leading by example—our levels of carbon pollution remain at historic lows. We must continue demonstrating that a country can simultaneously strive for a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.</FP>
  <FP>Despite this progress, there is much work to do to realize the clean energy economy of tomorrow. Last year, in partnership with 19 other countries, we launched Mission Innovation to accelerate clean energy innovation around the world. Through this initiative, 20 countries and the European Union committed to seeking to double public funding for clean energy research and development to $30 billion over 5 years. By doubling our proposed Federal investment in clean energy, we will enable our brightest scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to create and advance clean energy technologies that will protect our environment, increase our energy security, and create more jobs across our country.</FP>
  <FP>Although the difficulties that lie ahead are large, the stakes are too great for inaction. Our children and grandchildren are relying on our ability to rise to these challenges and accomplish what is required of us—including advancing clean, renewable, and independent sources of energy. Throughout National Energy Action Month, let us pledge to reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our energy consumption. Let us strive to continue fighting for a cleaner, stronger, and more secure future for our fellow Americans and for all of humanity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Energy Action Month. I call upon the citizens of the United States to recognize this month by working together to achieve greater energy security, a more robust economy, and a healthier environment for our children.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Youth Justice Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>The essential promise that we make to our young people—that where they start must not determine how far they can go—is part of what makes America exceptional. It is our shared responsibility to ensure all children are given a fair shot at life, including a quality education and equal opportunities to pursue their dreams. Too often in America, young people are not <PRTPAGE P="289"/>afforded a second chance after having made a mistake or poor decision—the kind of chance some of their peers receive under more forgiving environments. Many of these young people lack institutional or family support and live in distressed communities. Others may have experienced trauma and violence or may struggle with disabilities, mental health issues, or substance use disorders. As a society, we must strive to reach these children earlier in life and modernize our juvenile and criminal justice systems to hold youth accountable for their actions without consigning them to a life on the margins. During National Youth Justice Awareness Month, we reaffirm our commitment to helping children of every background become successful and engaged citizens.</FP>
  <FP>While the number of juvenile arrests have fallen sharply over the past decade, roughly 1 million juvenile arrests were made in 2014. An overwhelming majority of these arrests were for non-violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of those arrested were male. Children of color, particularly black and Hispanic males and Native American youth, continue to be overrepresented across all levels of the juvenile justice system. Unfortunately, far too many youth become involved with the adult criminal justice system each year—including in several States where 17-year-olds are prosecuted as adults regardless of their crime, and two where 16-year-olds are as well. Children in the adult system have less access to rehabilitative services and often face higher recidivism and suicide rates. Some States have recently raised the age so that 16- and 17-year-olds are not unnecessarily tried in adult courts, and many are reforming sentencing laws and expanding access to age-appropriate transition services upon reentry.</FP>
  <FP>Even for those youth who were never convicted or otherwise found guilty, simply having had contact with our justice system can lead to lifelong barriers and an increased likelihood of ending up in a cycle of incarceration. To help break this cycle, my Administration increased funding for expunging juvenile records and took steps to ensure young people in juvenile and adult justice facilities can receive Pell Grants to pursue a quality education. The White House launched the Fair Chance Pledge to highlight employers and institutions of higher education that have committed to reducing barriers that justice-involved youth often face in accessing employment, training, and education. To build on these efforts, the Congress must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) to increase protections for youth and limit the number of minors held in adult jails and prisons. Reauthorizing the JJDPA will promote evidence-based practices, quality education, and trauma-informed care for incarcerated youth, while reducing punishments for things such as breaking curfew and truancy.</FP>

  <FP>We have also seen too many of our youth held in solitary confinement while incarcerated, which can lead to devastating, long-term psychological consequences. Earlier this year, my Administration took steps to implement reforms that include banning this harmful practice for juveniles under the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We must ensure that young people have quality legal representation throughout every stage of the legal process as well as age-appropriate and rehabilitative sentencing and placements. The financial costs of the juvenile court system can be debilitating and can unfairly penalize children from poor families—by reducing the fees and fines imposed on youth, we can avoid pushing families into debt and decrease this disproportionate burden.<PRTPAGE P="290"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>To meet these goals, we must engage young people before they find themselves locked into a path from which they cannot escape. The Departments of Justice and Education created the Supportive School Discipline Initiative to incentivize positive school climates and rethink discipline policies to foster safer and more supportive learning environments. They are also working to assist States, schools, and law enforcement partners in assessing the proper role of school resource officers and campus law enforcement professionals. The Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services released a joint policy statement against the use of suspension and expulsion in preschool settings—which disproportionately affect children of color. As part of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's Smart on Juvenile Justice initiative, we are providing services such as job training and substance use disorder treatment and counseling for youth in juvenile facilities, and we are expanding the use of effective community-based alternatives to youth detention. We are also screening youth for exposure to trauma that can put them at greater risk of entering the juvenile justice system. And through the My Brother's Keeper initiative, we are working to address persistent opportunity gaps and ensure all young people can reach their full potential—including by helping them get a healthy start in life, enter school ready to learn, and successfully enter the workforce.</FP>
  <FP>When we invest in our children and redirect young people who have made misguided decisions, we can reduce our over-reliance on the juvenile and criminal justice systems and build stronger pathways to opportunity. In addition, for every dollar we put into high-quality early childhood education, we save at least twice that down the road in reduced crime. That is why my Administration has sought to expand high-quality early education by increasing funding for programs like Head Start and investing in preschool, child care, and evidence-based home visiting. Investing in our communities and our kids makes sense, and if we recognize that every child deserves to remain connected to their families and communities, we can ensure youth who come in contact with the law can have a chance at a brighter future.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we come together to ensure all young people are supported, nurtured, and provided an opportunity to succeed. We must make sure youth in every community and from every walk of life can be known for more than their worst mistakes. With enhanced possibilities, a sense of optimism, and an open mind, they can all thrive and live up to the full measure of their promise.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Youth Justice Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking action to support our youth and by participating in appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs in their communities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Community Policing Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Police officers are essential members of our communities—maintaining our way of life depends on their dedicated efforts to keep us safe. These officers hold significant civic and law enforcement responsibilities and put their lives at risk to protect us each day, at times facing some of the most adverse circumstances imaginable. The overwhelming majority of police officers are fair, dedicated, and honest public servants who strive daily to cultivate and sustain positive relationships with the communities they serve and protect. As recent tragedies have illustrated, however, it is clear that there are still too many places in America where these relationships are strained and where officers and community members have struggled to build and maintain trust.</FP>
  <FP>During National Community Policing Week, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting and advancing the practice of community policing and to fortifying the bonds between police officers and communities. Community policing recognizes that law enforcement cannot solve public safety problems alone and encourages interactive partnerships with relevant stakeholders—including community groups, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and businesses. This active collaboration can improve public trust and fortify relationships, not only advancing public safety, but also deepening social connectivity and creating lasting solutions to challenging problems we face every day.</FP>
  <FP>The underlying tensions that sometimes exist between law enforcement officers and communities span decades and reflect a breadth of social and cultural challenges, including racial and socioeconomic disparities. Through meaningful efforts to strengthen community policing, we can meet these challenges, improve these vital relationships, and make real and lasting progress. Together, we can take constructive steps to support our women and men in uniform while instilling confidence in the fairness of the justice system for everybody and ensuring that law enforcement officers discharge their duties impartially.</FP>

  <FP>A critical part of enhancing trust is making certain that when an incident occurs, the public is confident that an investigation is fair and effective—both for the officer and for the families of those who have been affected. We must also work with law enforcement on training, hiring, and recruiting techniques and provide support and proper resources as they deal with the challenges of the job. In 2015, I announced a Task Force on 21st Century Policing to bring together community leaders and law enforcement to provide recommendations to help us build the kind of trust we need. In the time since the Task Force issued a report of their findings, we have seen progress with respect to data gathering, training, transparency, and community outreach—and communities across America are working to implement these recommendations. We must also recognize that we cannot keep expecting police to solve the issues we fail to address as a society, including poverty, substandard schools, inadequate job opportunities, and <PRTPAGE P="292"/>lack of care for mental illnesses or substance use disorders; doing so contributes to unrest in communities and exacerbates tensions.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has worked to bridge divides and bolster community policing efforts across our country. In 2014, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice to invest in training, evidence-based strategies, and research to help reduce implicit bias and enhance procedural justice and reconciliation. The DOJ has provided additional resources to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services for hiring police officers across America and advancing 21st-century policing efforts. We are also continuing to provide millions of dollars in grants to agencies that demonstrate robust community policing initiatives. Last year, the White House and the DOJ launched the Police Data Initiative to encourage law enforcement, technologists, and researchers to use data to increase transparency and strengthen accountability between community members and police. And this summer, we launched the Data-Driven Justice Initiative to equip law enforcement officers with the tools they need to safely and effectively divert low-level offenders with mental illnesses out of the criminal justice system. The Federal Government must continue to partner with State and local leaders, as well as the law enforcement community, to expand best practices that increase trust and public safety.</FP>
  <FP>Every American has the power to make change in their communities. By working together to improve law enforcement practices and ensure we give both police officers and community members the respect they deserve, we can fulfill this important endeavor. This week, let us rededicate ourselves to building a future in which police officers are honored for their sacrifices and supported by their communities and in which members of those communities can truly feel they are being served fairly and justly by our women and men in blue.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2 through October 8, 2016, as National Community Policing Week. I call upon law enforcement agencies, elected officials, and all Americans to observe this week by recognizing ways to improve public safety, rebuild trust, and strengthen community relationships.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Youth Substance Use and Substance Use Disorder Prevention Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Far too many young people are unable to grow and thrive because of substance use. And far too many precious lives are being taken from us as a result of drug overdoses, leaving families devastated and heartbroken. Substance use can also lead to lower academic achievement and a variety of physical and emotional consequences, and it is crucial that America's youth learn and understand the risks connected with it. Youth substance use can be prevented—and with dedicated, collective effort across our communities, we can ensure more Americans live long, productive lives. During National Youth Substance Use and Substance Use Disorder Prevention Month, we come together in common purpose to unite behind this important mission.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration's <E T="03">National Drug Control Strategy</E> has enabled us to amplify prevention efforts by working with States to implement evidence-based strategies that support communities and strengthen drug-free programs. Every dollar invested in school-based substance use prevention programs can save nearly $18 in costs related to the disease of substance use disorder later on. We must facilitate open discussions with families and children—as well as health care providers—about the dangers posed by the misuse of prescription drugs, because for many individuals, their opioid use disorder starts by misusing prescription medications found in their home medicine cabinet. This is especially important because our Nation is currently facing an opioid epidemic, including a near quadrupling of opioid overdose deaths since 1999. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to provide $1.1 billion to expand access to treatment services for prescription opioid misuse and heroin use.</FP>
  <FP>With evidence-based approaches and community-led prevention activities, we can improve health and safety and give our young people the tools they need to make smart decisions. Parents, guardians, teachers, coaches, community members, and the health care community can all play a part in promoting substance use prevention efforts. This month, let us continue taking every step possible to increase these efforts for our young people—and for all Americans—so that they may pursue a bright future filled with possibility and opportunity.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Youth Substance Use and Substance Use Disorder Prevention Month.

  <FP>For centuries, German immigrants have ventured to American shores for the same reasons as so many others—to pursue new lives in a land of opportunity and forge brighter futures for themselves and their families. These immigrants and their descendants have changed the course of our history and paved our country's path of progress, and on German-American Day, we recognize their role in building a stronger and more prosperous Nation for all our people.</FP>
  <FP>From those who were among our earliest settlers and farmers to today's innovative leaders in business and public service, German Americans have shaped every sector of our society. More Americans can trace their roots to Germany than to any other nation, and elements of German heritage are embedded deeply in our country's character. German Americans have, throughout our history, proven that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and that no matter where we come from, as Americans we are united by the ideal that we are all created equal.</FP>
  <FP>Today, the alliance between the United States and Germany is one of the closest the world has ever known. Our cooperation in striving to protect the security and sustainability of our planet is guided by the enduring friendship between our citizens and the experiences and values that bind us together. On this occasion, let us honor the achievements of German Americans by renewing our devotion to beliefs borne out of common experience—by creating opportunity that lifts up not just the few but the many, and by affirming the inherent dignity and equality of every human being.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Manufacturing Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since our earliest days, innovation has been one of the most important driving forces of the American economy, and for generations, our manufacturing industry was the ticket to a good middle-class life. Over time, developing technology has changed the way we approach manufacturing. American manufacturing lost roughly one-third of its jobs in the first decade of the new century—during the global recession—and the middle class paid the price. Despite that, in recent years, through the determination of our resilient workforce, our economy and our manufacturing industry have been on the rise. Since 2010, we have added more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs and witnessed the fastest pace of manufacturing job growth since the 1990s—and today, factories are opening doors more quickly than at any time in the past 20 years. On National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate American manufacturing and recognize our potential to remain competitive by continuing to strengthen research, development, and our manufacturing sector.</FP>
  <FP>To build on this progress, we must keep America on the cutting edge of innovation and attract more high-quality manufacturing jobs for workers to fill in the 21st-century economy. We have worked to grow the jobs of tomorrow through Manufacturing USA, a national network of manufacturing hubs that bring businesses, research universities, and governments together to co-invest in the development of world-leading manufacturing technologies and capabilities. These manufacturing hubs not only enable some of the best minds in America to work together, but they also create a home for specific technology focus areas in manufacturing that attract people from around the world. Government can and should play a role in catalyzing this progress, which is why my Administration has already announced nine manufacturing hubs, with even more planned in the future. By supporting this network of global leadership in manufacturing, we are ensuring a steady stream of good jobs and pursuing the potential to fundamentally change the way we build things in America. I encourage everyone to visit www.Manufacturing.gov to learn more about the ways we have highlighted these partnerships to increase our competitiveness and advance our national manufacturing infrastructure.</FP>

  <FP>The growing maker movement has played a role in encouraging manufacturing. Through our Nation of Makers initiative, we have worked to give students, entrepreneurs, and all Americans access to new technologies so they can design and build anything they can dream of. The democratization of tools required to create products has been critical for supporting entrepreneurship and has led to a renaissance of American manufacturing—and we must continue to foster the culture of making and entrepreneurship. Our economic competitiveness in domestic manufacturing depends on critical investments in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. If we make the necessary investments to help students and <PRTPAGE P="296"/>young people experience hands-on STEM learning, we can spark a deep interest and help them develop the passion and creativity they need to excel in the 21st-century economy.</FP>
  <FP>Each year, hundreds of thousands of people observe this day by attending open houses, public tours, and career workshops. As we mark 5 years since the first National Manufacturing Day, we must inspire the next generation of workers and innovators to seek careers in manufacturing. Let us continue working to strengthen and expand the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow and ensure that opportunity for all is something we can keep making in America for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7, 2016, as National Manufacturing Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Fire Prevention Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than 1 million fires occur each year in the United States. Throughout the past decade, the number of fires—and of resulting deaths and injuries—has gone down. But residential fires still damage homes across our country, causing a higher percentage of fire deaths, injuries, and economic loss than any other fires, and wildfires continue to devastate our forests and threaten nearby homes and businesses. During Fire Prevention Week, we strive to increase our preparedness for fires and commit to giving dedicated firefighters the support they need to keep us safe.</FP>
  <FP>Every moment counts during a fire, and smoke alarms help save lives. However, many people do not know that their smoke alarms should be replaced every 10 years—after 10 years, they tend to become unreliable. I encourage everyone to check the manufacturing dates of their smoke alarms to see if they need replacing. Families and businesses should also develop and practice evacuation plans in case of emergencies and should prepare communication strategies in case of a fire. All Americans can learn more about steps they can take to prepare for fires by visiting www.Ready.gov.</FP>

  <FP>In recent years, we have experienced some of the most severe wildfire seasons in American history, including roughly 50,000 wildfires and over 9 million acres burned last year alone. Climate change exacerbates wildfire risks through drier landscapes and higher temperatures—we must recognize <PRTPAGE P="297"/>the effects our changing climate has on fire risks and help fire professionals and community leaders take action to enhance community resilience against these risks. Last year, my Administration brought together fire chiefs from around our country to identify key lessons learned from fires at the wildland-urban interface and actions that can be taken to reduce the harm to people and property associated with wildfires in these areas, where fighting fires is especially complicated, expensive, and dangerous. We need to be smarter about where we build, and we must work to better understand how fires behave so our firefighters can work more safely and effectively—we owe these heroic professionals nothing less.</FP>
  <FP>This week presents opportunities for businesses, families, and communities to learn about ways to protect themselves in case of fire and helps raise awareness of steps we can all take to prevent fires. During Fire Prevention Week, we also pause to honor our first responders and firefighters, including those who have sacrificed their own lives to save the lives of people they had never met. Let us salute them and pay tribute to all firefighters whose bravery, sense of duty, and love of country make our Nation a stronger, safer place.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2016, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 9, 2016, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National School Lunch Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Seventy years ago, President Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch Act, declaring “Nothing is more important in our national life than the welfare of our children, and proper nourishment comes first in attaining this welfare.” This Act created the National School Lunch Program and provided lunch to 7 million children in its first year—today, more than 30 million children depend on it each day. As we observe the 70th anniversary of this program, we recommit to ensuring access to proper nutrition throughout the school day for all our young people so that they may pursue their education and chase their dreams.</FP>

  <FP>Since the beginning of my Administration, I have worked to build on the legacy of the National School Lunch Program. In 2010, the Congress passed <PRTPAGE P="298"/>and I signed into law the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which increased the number of students who could get subsidized or free school meals and improved the quality of school meals. For children from low-income households, meals provided by the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program may be their only reliable source of nutrition throughout the day. We are working to increase access for more children, including by using Medicaid data to automatically connect eligible students in need to free or reduced-priced meals.</FP>
  <FP>During the school year, nearly 22 million children receive free and reduced-price school meals. When school is out for the summer, well over 2 million children rely on the Summer Food Service Program for nourishment. However, too many kids still lack access to adequate nutrition during the summer months, which is why I proposed investing $12 billion in my latest budget to provide supplemental summer food benefits to children who receive free and subsidized school meals during the academic year.</FP>

  <FP>We must also work to give children greater access to nutritious foods and empower them to make healthy choices. Too many young people are obese or overweight and remain at risk for health problems like diabetes or heart disease later in life. First Lady Michelle Obama has championed efforts to build healthy futures for all children, particularly through the <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative, which has worked to provide healthier meals in our schools and ensure every family has access to healthy, affordable food. The Department of Agriculture updated school nutrition standards to make sure all school meals and snacks meet science-based nutrition criteria, and almost all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are meeting these standards.</FP>
  <FP>In order for our children to join the most prepared and educated workforce in the world, we must remember the connection between what our kids eat and how well they perform in school. During National School Lunch Week, let us reaffirm our dedication to helping America's daughters and sons succeed by guaranteeing they have access to the healthy meals they need. Let us express our gratitude for the school nutrition professionals, educators, and administrators who are helping deliver the promise of a bright future to schoolchildren across America each day.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in October each year as “National School Lunch Week” and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2016, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being of our Nation's children.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Leif Erikson Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>More than 1,000 years ago, an intrepid Scandinavian explorer, Leif Erikson, embarked on a voyage that landed him on the North American coast. A son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, Erikson and his crew are believed to be the first Europeans to reach the shores of our continent, founding the Vinland settlement in modern-day Canada. Today, we recall Leif Erikson's historic journey as we seek to carry forward the bold spirit of exploration that has inspired Nordic Americans for generations.</FP>

  <FP>Eight centuries after Leif Erikson's trip, six families of Norwegians boarded a ship called <E T="03">Restauration</E> bound for New York City. Following in Erikson's footsteps, these individuals sought the promise of freedom and opportunity America offered and became the first group of organized American immigrants from Norway. Millions of Americans proudly trace their ancestry to Nordic countries, raised by parents and grandparents who crossed oceans to carve out new lives for their families and help steer the course of our country. The United States and our Nordic partners are united by ties of family and friendship, history and heritage. Earlier this year, I was proud to welcome Nordic leaders to the White House. This visit illustrated many of the values and interests we share—including increasing opportunity for all and recognizing the inherent dignity of every human being.</FP>
  <FP>Nordic countries remain some of our most reliable and effective partners, steadfastly helping us meet the shared challenges of our time. We remain grateful for their friendship, and for the ways the Nordic people have influenced our country and enhanced the American melting pot. On Leif Erikson Day, as we express our appreciation for the myriad contributions of Nordic Americans, let us remember the discovery that set this profound history in motion.</FP>
  <FP>To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as “Leif Erikson Day.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2016, as Leif Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Columbus Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In October of 1492, Christopher Columbus completed the first of his expeditions that would land him on the shores of North America. Sponsored by Isabella I and Ferdinand II, Columbus embarked on a 10-week voyage he had hoped would lead to Asia. But when his ships instead landed in the Bahamas, a new story began to unfold. The spirit of exploration that Columbus embodied was sustained by all who would follow him westward, driving a desire to continue expanding our understanding of the world.</FP>
  <FP>Though Columbus departed from the coast of Spain, his roots traced back to his birthplace of Genoa, Italy. Blazing a trail for generations of Italian explorers and Italian Americans to eventually seek the promise of the New World, his voyage churned the gears of history. The bonds between Italy and the United States could not be closer than they are today—a reflection of the extraordinary contributions made by both our peoples in our common efforts to shape a better future. Across our Nation, Italian Americans continue to enrich our country's traditions and culture.</FP>
  <FP>As we mark this rich history, we must also acknowledge the pain and suffering reflected in the stories of Native Americans who had long resided on this land prior to the arrival of European newcomers. The past we share is marked by too many broken promises, as well as violence, deprivation, and disease. It is a history that we must recognize as we seek to build a brighter future—side by side and with cooperation and mutual respect. We have made great progress together in recent years, and we will keep striving to maintain strong nation-to-nation relationships, strengthen tribal sovereignty, and help all our communities thrive.</FP>
  <FP>More than five centuries ago, one journey changed the trajectory of our world—and today we recognize the spirit that Christopher Columbus's legacy inspired. As we reflect on the adventurers throughout history who charted new courses and sought new heights, let us remember the communities who suffered, and let us pay tribute to our heritage and embrace the multiculturalism that defines the American experience.</FP>
  <FP>In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage 524 years ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as “Columbus Day.”</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2016, as Columbus Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Over two centuries ago, Polish immigrant Casimir Pulaski crossed an ocean to take up the cause of defending a young nation. Rising quickly to the rank of Brigadier General in the Continental Army, he reformed our cavalry, saved the life of General George Washington, and helped secure our independence. Today, we celebrate the legacy of liberty he forged and reflect on the many ways Polish-American voices continue to shape the unending story of our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>Spending his formative years in Poland laboring for his home country's independence, General Pulaski came to America with both an expertise in combat and a passion for liberty that made him invaluable to our new Nation's fight for freedom. Leading a legion of men on horseback and working alongside General Washington, General Pulaski achieved victory after victory. But he would never see the results of his valiant efforts fully realized—he succumbed to battle injuries on October 11, 1779, giving his final full measure of devotion in defense of the ideals we cherish.</FP>
  <FP>More than 200 years later, Polish Americans across our country honor the spirit of General Pulaski through their many contributions to our Nation and through living the values that unite us all. The proud members of the Polish-American community strengthen the rich heritage of our country—many serve in our Armed Forces, protecting the very freedoms General Pulaski helped secure centuries before—and they reflect the strong friendship that endures today between the United States and Poland.</FP>
  <FP>On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we commemorate one of our Nation's earliest embodiments of the belief that no matter who you are or where you come from, those who love this country can change it for the better. In honor of General Pulaski's sacrifice and the important role Polish Americans play in our country, let us rededicate ourselves to defending our founding ideal of liberty for all.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2016, as General Pulaski Memorial Day.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">International Day of the Girl, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>No matter where she lives, every girl on this planet deserves the chance to learn and grow, to develop her mind and her talents, and to live a life of her own choosing. Although we have made life significantly better for our daughters than it was for our mothers and grandmothers, in too many parts of the world, girls are still undervalued, disrespected, abused, and prevented from contributing to society. On International Day of the Girl, we recognize our obligation to lift up women and girls at home and abroad and to build a world where all girls feel safe and empowered in their classrooms, their communities, and their homes.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to combating gender disparities, and through the White House Council on Women and Girls, we have made it a priority to consider the needs of women and girls in our policies, laws, and programs. Today, more American women have the freedom to make their own choices about their lives—about their bodies, their education, their career. The Affordable Care Act has ensured that more girls have access to quality, affordable health care and that no health insurer can charge them more simply because of their gender. By encouraging the media to depict more examples of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields—and by working to expand access to STEM classes and careers, particularly computer science—we are striving to address inequalities in education. We will continue to pursue policies that advance gender equality here at home, from equal pay for equal work to protecting reproductive rights, because while some girls have never had more opportunities, there are still many who remain in the toughest of circumstances.</FP>

  <FP>Under the leadership of Vice President Joe Biden, we are working to put an end to violence against women, and we have launched a movement to fight sexual assault and support survivors. Through the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the “It's On Us” campaign, we are shining a light on the unconscionable rates of sexual assault against teens and young adults in primary and secondary schools and on college campuses. My Administration recently announced new guidance and resources to help district administrators and educators prevent and appropriately deal with sexual assault in K-12 settings. We have also provided guidance to educators on ways to address harassment and discrimination of students in school settings, including transgender girls and women—who too often face bullying and abuse that harm their education. The Department of Justice also released guidance to identify and prevent gender bias in law enforcement responses to sexual assault and domestic <PRTPAGE P="303"/>violence cases. And because 84 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls will experience some form of violence in their lifetimes, we have protected the ability of tribes to prosecute non-Native perpetrators of domestic violence in Indian Country through provisions included in the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.</FP>

  <FP>As we work to expand opportunities here in the United States, we must also look abroad and acknowledge that any country that oppresses half of its population—that prevents women and girls from going to school or work or refuses to give them control over their bodies or safety from gender-motivated abuse—is not a society that can thrive. The ideologies that harm girls and prevent them from fulfilling their potential are the same ideologies that have led countries to instability, violence, and terrorism. That is why earlier this year, we launched the <E T="03">U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls</E>—a strategy aimed at bringing Federal agencies together to comprehensively improve the lives of girls around the world, safeguard their rights, and encourage their full social, political, and economic participation. To specifically focus on the challenge of adolescent girls' education, First Lady Michelle Obama and I launched the <E T="03">Let Girls Learn</E> initiative, through which we are working with companies, organizations, and foreign governments to help give adolescent girls around the world the chance to go to school—because a world in which all girls have access to an education is a safer, fairer, and more stable place. The initiative includes more than a billion dollars for funding new and ongoing programming in more than 50 countries to help adolescent girls attend and stay in school. And the White House will soon host the first meeting of the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls to champion regional coordination on the rights of women and girls from indigenous communities across North America.</FP>
  <FP>Around the world—from Africa to Southeast Asia to Latin America—we are striving to improve girls' welfare, build their skills, and promote their participation as the next generation of leaders. We are working to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls in fragile settings as well as support refugees and displaced persons around the world. We are undertaking targeted efforts to address child, early, and forced marriage, and we are investing in new programs, including survivor-led programs, to end female genital mutilation and cutting in seven countries across Southeast Asia and West Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, we are helping adolescent girls pay for and attend school, while ensuring they learn about HIV and violence prevention. We have sponsored “Women in Science” camps in Peru and Rwanda to give girls abroad the opportunity to learn how to use technology to improve their communities. We are also working with Pakistan to advance women's economic participation and entrepreneurship and launch the country's first “Take Your Daughter to Work Day.” And we remain committed to ending human trafficking and have taken unprecedented steps to provide comprehensive services to victims, bring traffickers to justice, apply new technologies to combat modern slavery, and provide training and promote awareness at home and abroad.</FP>

  <FP>This summer, 5,000 leaders from around the world gathered at the first ever United State of Women Summit to highlight the work we have done and to build an agenda for the future. But we know there is still more to do, and I have made advancing gender equality a foreign policy priority to <PRTPAGE P="304"/>ensure we can continue removing barriers that prevent women from reaching their full potential. More than our policies, we must commit to changing the culture that raises our daughters to be demure or criticizes them for speaking out—and to changing the attitude that permits the routine harassment of women and girls, whether walking down the street or going online. We are working with communities and businesses that are rethinking workplace policies, funding women entrepreneurs, expanding female leadership, and creating more opportunities for women and girls who too often face disproportionate challenges—including women and girls of color, women and girls with disabilities, and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women and girls—because everyone has a role to play and everybody deserves the chance to pursue their dreams.</FP>
  <FP>This is the future we are forging: Where women and girls, no matter what they look like or where they are from, can live free from the fear of violence. A future where all girls know they can hold any job, run any company, and compete in any field. Today, we recommit ourselves to the belief that when everyone has the opportunity to go to school, explore their passions, and achieve their dreams, our communities are stronger, more resilient, and better positioned for peace and prosperity. Let us keep working to build a world that is more just and free—because nothing should stand in the way of strong girls with bold dreams.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2016, as International Day of the Girl. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and activities that advance equality and opportunity for girls everywhere.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our country has survived centuries of trial and triumph, and we have endured times that have tested us and marked moments of progress that were once deemed impossible. Today, we live in a time of extraordinary possibility—and we must decide how our next chapters will be written. The task of shaping America's course falls to each one of us as individuals who make up our American family, and as we celebrate National Character Counts Week, let us seek to live out the ideals that have inspired our country's journey and that define our national character.</FP>

  <FP>No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, or what your circumstances are, America should be a place where the things that <PRTPAGE P="305"/>make you unique and different are celebrated. That promise of equality and acceptance has been our country's North Star since its founding, and in thinking of how that centuries-old ideal translates into our lives today, it comes down to all of us showing others the compassion and acceptance that we would only wish for ourselves. If we seek to understand one another and take advantage of opportunities to bring people together across lines of difference, we will increasingly realize as a people that we are more alike than we are different.</FP>
  <FP>Let us listen to each other, see each other, and recognize the common humanity that makes America what it is. Let us embrace the multitudes of races, faiths, cultures, and origins that make up our diverse, vibrant Nation. It will make us better as a people and stronger as a country, and it starts with reflecting on the way we live our lives, the way we treat others, and the example we set for those around us. We have a collective obligation to reflect in our own lives the values we strive to reflect in our national life, and no gesture of goodwill is too small—together, ripples of kindness can drown out voices of hate, wash away cynicism and doubt, and help us see the world in truer colors.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Filtering the air we breathe and the water we drink, and providing the habitats that are home to diverse species of fish and wildlife, forests are an essential part of our planet. Across America, they offer a wide range of cultural and recreational activities that have sustained and entertained people since long before our Nation's founding. Today, forests provide products we use each day, including paper, wood, and building and packaging materials. During National Forest Products Week, we express our appreciation for the incredible bounty forests provide and we renew our commitment to ensuring the next generation can enjoy their irreplaceable resources.</FP>

  <FP>Our forests are at increasing risk from catastrophic wildfires, erosion, drought, and climate change. That is why my Administration is working alongside State and local leaders, landowners, and businesses to develop <PRTPAGE P="306"/>solutions to preserve our forests—because we must respond to challenges that threaten these important spaces. America's forests play an important role in addressing climate change by absorbing carbon pollution. It is critical that we protect and restore our forests, and through the Climate Action Plan, Federal agencies are coming together to strengthen the resilience of our forests and enhance their ability to absorb even more carbon pollution.</FP>
  <FP>The health and well-being of our forests and our communities go hand in hand. With the Department of Agriculture, we are working to strengthen markets for forest products. By allocating millions of dollars to help expand technologies that encourage the use of wood in innovative ways, we are also striving to improve forest health and generate rural jobs. And we are exploring ways to help forestland owners respond to climate change—earlier this year, we released a roadmap for implementing key building blocks to achieve this goal, such as private forest growth and retention, stewardship of Federal forests, and promotion of wood products.</FP>
  <FP>Forests generate billions of dollars in economic growth, sustaining local economies and enhancing communities across our country. We rely on them in so many aspects of our national life, and throughout this week, we must continue working to protect the precious resources our forests hold so they can continue enriching our world and supporting our way of life.</FP>
  <FP>To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as “National Forest Products Week” and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Blind Americans Equality Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Each day, blind and visually impaired Americans contribute to our society, refusing to allow anything to hold them back. In order to ensure more Americans with disabilities can continue participating fully in our country, we must each do our part to promote equal opportunity for all. On Blind Americans Equality Day, we reaffirm the inherent dignity of every human <PRTPAGE P="307"/>being and recommit to forging a future in which all Americans, including those with visual impairments, can pursue their full measure of happiness.</FP>
  <FP>More than two decades ago, one of the most comprehensive civil rights bills in our history, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), was signed into law. Ever since, the ADA has helped reduce discrimination and promote equal access to classrooms, workplaces, and transportation—and it is imperative that we build on the significant progress we have made for individuals living with disabilities. Because the unemployment rate is more than twice as high for Americans with disabilities, my Administration has worked to improve employment opportunities, including within the Federal Government where we are leading as a model employer. Last year, we hosted the White House Summit on Disability and Employment, which provided resources to help employers hire more individuals with disabilities. And through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we expanded access to critical services for many individuals with disabilities, including those who are blind or visually impaired, so that they can pursue high-quality employment opportunities. People with disabilities deserve to live their lives in their communities and raise their families, and earlier this year we hosted a Forum on the Civil Rights of Parents with Disabilities because every family, including those headed by people with disabilities, deserves the chance to reach for a future of ever greater possibility.</FP>
  <FP>Our Nation must continue to promote equal opportunity and the right of all Americans to live full and independent lives. This begins early on—we must ensure that any child with a print disability can access the tools they need to pursue an education. That is why we have worked to provide appropriate materials and services, including Braille and Braille literacy instruction, in schools. We are investing in technologies that provide visually impaired students equal access to the general education curriculum. We are also working to make the websites of Government agencies and private companies more accessible to anyone with a disability—an effort which remains an important priority. And I have encouraged the Senate to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, which will broaden access to a new world of knowledge for these individuals.</FP>
  <FP>Disability touches us all, and together we can strive to ensure that all blind and visually impaired individuals face no unnecessary barriers to success. By providing equal access to resources and technologies and giving everyone the chance to make of their lives what they will, we can continue to advance opportunity and prosperity for all our people.</FP>
  <FP>By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as “White Cane Safety Day” to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or have low vision. Today, let us reaffirm our commitment to being a Nation where all our people, including those with disabilities, have every opportunity to achieve their dreams.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2016, as Blind Americans Equality Day.

Women and men of every faith, background, and race have channeled their talents and ingenuity into harnessing the spirit of innovation that has long been the hallmark of our people. And as an essential part of our country's story, minority-owned enterprises have helped spur this progress. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we reflect on the significant ways they have helped put our economy on the path to success, and we recommit to empowering every hardworking American to write our next great chapters.</FP>
  <FP>Minority-owned firms employ millions of workers and generate more than $1 trillion in economic output, revitalizing our communities and driving our growth. That is why my Administration is helping entrepreneurs of all backgrounds and small businesses across our country get the resources they need to get off the ground. Through the Minority Business Development Agency, we have led efforts to promote growth and competitiveness. We are helping streamline the process of starting a company and investing in entrepreneurship training and skill building for more Americans. Through www.Business.USA.gov, we are helping more enterprises get information about Federal contracts, and we are connecting them to critical resources to help develop and grow a business. In today's global economy, minority-owned businesses are essential to our country's success. They are twice as likely as other businesses to export their goods and services, and I am working to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation through a smart trade agenda that will allow us to sell more goods, boost economic competitiveness, and help more of our entrepreneurs thrive.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation has always drawn strength from the diversity of our people, and no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from, America is a place where everyone deserves a chance to get ahead. This week, we must continue working to support minority enterprises and all entrepreneurs—and ensure that by expanding access to the networks, capital, and opportunities required to build a business, everybody can have a fair shot at reaching their piece of the American dream.<PRTPAGE P="309"/>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 23 through October 29, 2016, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our Nation's minority enterprises.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are living monuments to the cause that has driven each generation of our citizens in the task of perfecting our Union—helping ensure that all people can experience the fullest measure of equality, justice, and possibility. Embodying the notion that the ability to pursue a higher education should be an opportunity available to all, rather than a privilege for a few, these campuses were built from a determination to widely and profoundly expand the reach of our country's promise. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we celebrate this aspiration and reaffirm our support for HBCUs.</FP>
  <FP>Rendered possible by the extraordinary sacrifices and commitment of women and men who resolved to make real and enduring the new birth of freedom that echoed across our country following the end of the Civil War, the rise of these proud institutions marked the beginning of a new chapter in our national narrative. With each generation, HBCUs have shaped America for the better in indelible ways. From a pastor who would give voice to equality's cause to the great-grandson of a slave who would reach the bench of our highest court; from pioneers of medical and scientific breakthroughs to creators of innovative and prosperous businesses; from artists who expand the boundaries of expression to historians who illuminate our past and help us write our future, so much of the progress that has come to define America has been carried forward by graduates, academics, and leaders of these colleges and universities.</FP>

  <FP>Since I took office, my Administration has focused on expanding opportunity and opening doors of higher education for more people. We have increased Pell Grants, expanded student loan assistance going directly to students, cut taxes for those paying tuition, allowed students to cap their Federal loan payments at 10 percent of their income, and created the College Scorecard to assist prospective students in understanding their options for pursuing a higher education. Today, more Americans are earning a degree <PRTPAGE P="310"/>in post-secondary education than ever before, and HBCUs are playing an important role. In the 6 years since I signed an Executive Order bolstering the White House Initiative on HBCUs, we have helped ensure that more students have greater opportunities and that these institutions can benefit from a fuller range of Federal programs and assistance. HBCUs and community colleges help build our Nation's economy and strengthen the middle class, which is why I am working to make 2 years of community college free for hardworking students across our country through America's College Promise—a proposal that also helps 4-year HBCUs provide more low-income students with up to 2 years of college for free or at reduced tuition.</FP>
  <FP>This week, we recognize the ways in which HBCUs are central to our experience as a Nation and recommit ourselves to the work that lies ahead. Let us honor the spirit in which these institutions were constructed by reaffirming the enduring truths at their core, and let us continue endeavoring to ensure all people have the chance to access higher education and secure ever greater opportunity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 23 through October 29, 2016, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon educators, public officials, professional organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to our country.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">United Nations Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Seventy-one years ago, after rolling back a tide of tyranny that threatened Europe and the world, members of the international community came together to sign the United Nations Charter—advancing a promise to replace the ravages of war with the possibilities of diplomacy. On United Nations Day, we reflect on the progress we have made in the time since, resolve to carry this progress forward, and reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations across the globe.</FP>

  <FP>Today, because of the international order the United Nations has helped anchor for more than seven decades, we live in a global community that, together, has overcome the greatest financial crisis of our time, lifted billions of people out of poverty, promoted the emergence of more democracies, and taken meaningful steps toward leaving our children with a <PRTPAGE P="311"/>world that is safer, cleaner, and more stable. Yet the same forces of integration that have helped forge closer ties and stronger partnerships among the world's nations also have exposed deep fault lines that we must address. In too many places around the world, perpetrators of atrocities go unpunished and those who violate international law face no consequences. Climate change remains a serious threat—even after we officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect earlier this month. Too many governments still silence journalists, quash dissent, and censor vital flows of information. And in camps and cities around the world, families live as refugees, surviving on aid and the compassion of others. These issues present crises of our shared security and challenges to our international system in which all nations must share in our collective responsibilities. Our world is too small, and our destinies too intertwined, for us not to see ourselves in one another. By upholding the values upon which the United Nations was founded—pluralism, diversity, human rights, and togetherness—we can ensure we pass these tests of our common humanity. And by continuing to build a more capable and effective United Nations, we strengthen the world's capacity to respond to global crises, keep peace in fragile societies, and tackle unprecedented humanitarian challenges.</FP>
  <FP>The international community relies on the United Nations today more than ever before. Now in its eighth decade, this institution—and those selfless individuals who devote their lives to sustaining it—is vital to our mission of shaping a better world: one defined by cooperation over confrontation, a shared sense of purpose, and the understanding that the future of a child in America is inextricably linked to that of a child in Afghanistan. On this day, let us pay tribute to the staff of the United Nations, particularly the more than 100,000 uniformed personnel serving in peacekeeping missions, for their selfless service to the cause of promoting international peace and prosperity, and as citizens of the world, let us renew our shared commitment to forging a brighter tomorrow for all.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2016, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Military Family Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>For generations, brave Americans have stepped forward and answered our country's call to serve in our Armed Forces. With honor and distinction, <PRTPAGE P="312"/>our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen fight to defend the principles upon which our Republic was founded so that we might live in a freer and more prosperous world. Behind these courageous Americans stand spouses, children, and parents who give up precious time with their loved ones, bearing the burden of long deployments and difficult moves, and oftentimes putting their careers on hold. During Military Family Month, we salute the families of those who proudly are a part of our Nation's unbroken chain of patriots for their unwavering devotion, and we renew our sacred vow to uphold our promise to our troops, our veterans, and their families.</FP>
  <FP>Our military would not be the greatest in the world without the strength and support of the loved ones who stand alongside our men and women in uniform. While our service members are fighting to secure the values we cherish and defend our homeland, their spouses keep their households running, sometimes through multiple deployments. Spouses of those in the military are often forced to relocate across our country or around the globe, leaving behind jobs they love and sometimes struggling to find new employment. They are our fellow citizens and neighbors; in their service to their families and their country, they represent the true strength of America.</FP>

  <FP>Our Nation has a solemn obligation to support and care for the members of our military and their families—from their first day of training until they conclude their service—and my Administration has worked to ensure we uphold this promise. Through First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's <E T="03">Joining Forces</E> initiative, we have worked with both the public and private sectors to ensure service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. Over the past 5 years, we have rallied businesses to hire more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses. Today, every single State has taken action to streamline professional licensing and credentialing processes so that military spouses can continue their work when they move across State lines without having to re-certify for a job they are already qualified for. We are also working to provide the resources military families need to start businesses and pursue an education, and we are helping teachers and schools support military children from kindergarten through college. By partnering with the private sector, we have also helped expand access to essential science, technology, engineering, and math courses so that 60,000 more military children can be college-ready and prepared for 21st-century careers.</FP>
  <FP>We must always be there for our service members and their families—just as they are there for us. Through the thickest of fights and the darkest of nights, our extraordinary military families—our heroes on the home front—stand alongside our patriots in uniform, and in their example we see the very best of our country's spirit. This month, let us thank them for their tremendous devotion to duty and for their unyielding sacrifice. Let us honor their resolve and patriotism and uphold our solemn responsibility to ensure the priorities of our Nation reflect the priorities of our military families.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as Military Family Month. I encourage all Americans to honor military families <PRTPAGE P="313"/>through private actions and public service for the tremendous contributions they make in support of our service members and our Nation.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Adoption Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Across America, adoptive parents welcome children into stable, loving families, providing a safe and comforting place for children in need to call home. Families who choose the life-changing path of adoption make a meaningful and lasting difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, or religion, devoted Americans who adopt help give more children the upbringing they deserve. Each November, we recognize the important role that adoption has played in the lives of children and families in our country and around the world, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring every child can find their forever family.</FP>
  <FP>Last year, more than 100,000 children were waiting to be adopted from foster care, and every year, too many older youth age out of the foster care system before they are able to find permanence. Without this support during the critical years of early adulthood, these youth are more likely than their peers to experience homelessness, unemployment, or incarceration. To make the possibility of adoption real for more children across our country, my Administration has eliminated barriers to adoption by extending tax credits and providing financial incentives to child welfare agencies in almost every State to maximize adoptions. I have also worked to strengthen Federal workplace flexibility policies to ensure more families, including adoptive families, can keep their jobs and care for their children as their family grows.</FP>
  <FP>On the Saturday before Thanksgiving, we also recognize National Adoption Day, kicking off a week of reflection and gratitude for many adoptive families. Each year on this day, thousands of adoptions are finalized, including more than 4,000 children in 2015. This year, cities from coast to coast will host a variety of events to commemorate the occasion.</FP>

  <FP>One of the most important jobs many of us will ever have is being a parent. Throughout National Adoption Month, we celebrate all those who have invited a child in need into their hearts and into their homes, and we express our profound appreciation for all who help make adoptions possible. Let us continue strengthening the adoption process so that all children can learn, grow, and thrive with the support of a devoted and permanent family.<PRTPAGE P="314"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by answering the call to find a permanent and caring family for every child in need and by supporting the families who care for them.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National College Application Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In America, all people deserve an equal chance to succeed, and expanding access to affordable higher education is necessary for bringing us closer to fulfilling this ideal. Over the past several generations, our country built a strong middle class through a commitment to keeping a high-quality education within reach for all those willing to work for it, and now more than ever, a college degree is the surest path to the middle class. During National College Application Month, we encourage Americans to apply for a higher education, and we strive to ensure every student—no matter who they are or where they come from—has a chance at the opportunities they need to thrive.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration is committed to giving students and their families important information on college admissions, value, and costs so they can make decisions that are right for them. Last year, we redesigned a new College Scorecard with direct input from students, families, and advisers to provide clear and accessible national data on college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings. By visiting CollegeScorecard.Ed.gov, more Americans can evaluate college choices based on the factors that matter most to them. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher initiative, we are inspiring more students to pursue a higher education, ensuring they have what they need to complete their college education, and helping them understand their financial aid eligibility. And we are working to reduce barriers to educational opportunity through the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge—an effort in which public and private colleges and universities are helping provide individuals with criminal records who have already paid their debt to society a fair chance to seek a higher education. To learn more about ways we are helping more Americans pursue a higher education, visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/ReachHigher.</FP>

  <FP>Although earning a college degree is one of the most important investments individuals can make for themselves and for our country, it still feels out of reach for too many American families. That is why we have taken many steps to make college more affordable, including doubling investments in <PRTPAGE P="315"/>grant and scholarship aid through Pell Grants and tax credits, keeping interest rates low on Federal student loans, and helping borrowers manage debt after college through programs like the Pay as You Earn plan. This year, we launched the Free Application for Federal Student Aid—which is available at www.FAFSA.gov—3 months earlier than usual so that students can access financial aid sooner and receive better information as they search for and apply to colleges. And because every American at any age and from any walk of life should be able to earn the skills necessary to compete in the 21st-century economy, I have proposed making community college free for students with the drive and discipline to work for it.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we recognize the limitless potential in every student and reaffirm our commitment to offering them the resources they need to succeed. We thank not only the teachers, counselors, and parents who support students throughout the college application process, but also the organizations and institutions partnering with us to eliminate unnecessary barriers to higher education. Let us celebrate the progress we have made as more historically underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time, more students are graduating from college than ever before, and new student loan defaults are on the decline. And together, let us forge a future where every student has the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National College Application Month. I call upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs designed to encourage students to make plans for and apply to college.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Diabetes Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>More than 29 million Americans have diabetes—a disease in which the glucose levels in one's blood are higher than normal. Although the rate of new cases is falling, the numbers are still alarming. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and results in staggering health and financial costs for Americans. With a concentrated effort to reduce the number of new diagnoses and improve treatment and care for those living with this disease, we must continue making progress in the battle against this epidemic. Each year during National Diabetes Month, we resolve to <PRTPAGE P="316"/>support everyone battling this chronic disease, and we recommit to fighting it so that more Americans can lead a healthy life.</FP>
  <FP>Diabetes can affect individuals of any age, gender, or background depending on risk factors, which can include a combination of genetics and lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in youth, affects people whose bodies do not produce enough insulin, a hormone needed to live. Type 2 diabetes occurs in people who are not able to produce enough insulin to meet their body's needs, and typically develops in adults—however, more young people today are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than ever before, and it is more commonly diagnosed among those who are obese or inactive. Both types can lead to health problems such as heart disease, blindness, and kidney failure. Additionally, roughly one-third of American adults have prediabetes—a condition in which their blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes—placing them at higher risk for other health conditions or for developing type 2 diabetes. Another form of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, can develop in pregnant women, create complications during pregnancy, and increase chances of developing type 2 diabetes later in life for both mothers and their children.</FP>
  <FP>Type 1 diabetes accounts for a smaller proportion of diagnosed cases of diabetes; over 90 percent of all diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes. Individuals with type 1 diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar levels and take insulin every day to survive. Diabetes has no cure, but people with type 2 diabetes can manage their disease by following a healthy meal plan, increasing physical activity, taking prescribed medications, and quitting smoking if applicable. For individuals with prediabetes or overweight individuals at higher risk of diabetes, losing weight through healthy eating and regular physical activity can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Americans with any type of diabetes should get regular checkups and work with health care professionals to learn more about this disease. Individuals at higher risk—particularly those who are overweight, older than 45, or have a family history of type 2 diabetes—should talk to their health care providers about their diabetes risk. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. I encourage all Americans to visit www.NDEP.NIH.gov to find resources available through the National Diabetes Education Program to help make and sustain healthy lifestyle and behavior changes.</FP>
  <FP>Over the last 8 years, my Administration has worked to provide better care, prevention, and treatment for anyone suffering from diabetes. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has required that insurers cover preventive services such as certain diabetes screenings without copays or deductibles, and seniors can now receive these screenings free of charge as well. Insurance companies can no longer deny individuals coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a family history of diabetes, and children can now stay on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26. By supporting the Diabetes Prevention Program—the first preventive service model eligible for expansion under Medicare—the ACA has improved the quality of care, reduced health care costs, and helped prevent the onset of diabetes.</FP>

  <FP>Nearly one in three American children is overweight or obese, causing a rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children. Unless we act, <PRTPAGE P="317"/>approximately one-third of all children born since the turn of the century will suffer from diabetes during their lifetimes. The First Lady's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative has worked to reverse this childhood obesity trend and put children on a path to a healthy future during their earliest years by fostering environments that support healthy choices; promoting physical activity; providing healthier foods in our schools; and ensuring families have access to nutritious, affordable foods and the information they need to make healthy choices. We have also harnessed the American spirit of innovation through our Precision Medicine Initiative: By tailoring treatments to individuals based on personalized information such as genetics, we can move closer to curing diseases like diabetes and give more Americans the opportunity to live full, healthy lives.</FP>
  <FP>Every year, too many Americans experience the consequences of diabetes—but in part because of the dedication of our Nation's health care providers, researchers, and advocates, we have made important strides in combating this disease, and we have reason to hope this progress will continue. This month, let us work to show every individual living with diabetes that they are not alone, and let us continue strengthening our investment in the fight against this disease.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>From the energy that powers our homes to the systems that allow us to communicate with one another, our critical infrastructure is essential to the stability and strength of our national security, economy, and public health. The assets, networks, and systems that enable us to innovate and prosper are necessary for sustaining and supporting the well-being of our Nation, and our increasing dependence on them makes securing and protecting them a top priority. This month, we recognize the importance of our critical infrastructure and resolve to safeguard these vital systems so they remain strong and resilient.</FP>

  <FP>Our critical infrastructure spans a wide array of structures and systems we rely on to meet our day-to-day needs. It includes government facilities, the <PRTPAGE P="318"/>electric grid, transportation and water systems, information technology, and financial systems—all which play an equally important role in maintaining our way of life. These complex systems work together to keep us safe and healthy, and although they are among the most advanced and secure in the world, we must remain vigilant and ensure their resilience by mitigating the threats and stresses that can weaken them.</FP>
  <FP>Securing our complex critical infrastructure systems requires cooperation and sustained commitment from everyone, which is why my Administration is working with businesses, infrastructure owners, and officials at all levels of government to protect them. We must take necessary steps to modernize our roads, bridges, pipes, and ports to ensure they remain resilient and strong—especially as climate change becomes an increasing risk, causing more extreme weather events that threaten our infrastructure. In addition to physical threats and hazards, cybersecurity risks pose another significant challenge to our Nation. We must ensure that addressing threats to the security of our data and our digital networks remains a priority. By partnering with the private sector, and with the help of the American people, we can prepare our critical infrastructure to withstand and respond to cyber threats, terrorist attacks, acts of nature including space weather events, and other threats and hazards.</FP>
  <FP>Three years ago, I issued a Presidential Policy Directive to strengthen and maintain secure and resilient critical infrastructure. Today, we are continuing to carry out this vision for how Government and the private sector can work together to reduce risks and increase the stability and security of our infrastructure. And because our world has never been more interconnected, we know that keeping our critical infrastructure functioning will require collaboration with international partners. That is why we are working to promote global critical infrastructure security and resilience through information sharing with partners around the world.</FP>
  <FP>As our population grows and our technology advances, the demands of our critical infrastructure become increasingly significant. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to reducing risks to these important systems and preparing to adapt and respond to any incident that may occur. To ensure more Americans can thrive in a future of greater safety, stability, and prosperity, we must protect and enhance these essential elements of our cyber and physical infrastructure for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate events and training to enhance our national security and resilience.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>A heartbreaking disease present in more than 5 million Americans, Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia and causes people to lose many of the critical abilities they need to live independently. Too often, those suffering from Alzheimer's cannot recognize their loved ones or remember how to perform daily tasks, struggling physically and mentally with things that once came naturally. Although we have long known Alzheimer's to be irreversible and fatal, we maintain hope that by advancing research and treatment options we can work to change these outcomes and ensure brighter prospects for all those who face this disease. During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we resolve to continue working toward this brighter future as we stand with every person battling, Alzheimer's and their loved ones.</FP>
  <FP>Alzheimer's disease is more likely to affect Americans as they grow older—although genetics can also play a role, age is the most significant risk factor. But Alzheimer's touches many more individuals than simply those who are diagnosed. Dedicated caregivers—whether professionals, family members, or friends—are also emotionally, physically, and financially affected by Alzheimer's disease, giving of themselves to ensure those who face it are not alone. And because these individuals need access to information and resources in order to provide this essential care, we launched www.Alzheimers.gov to give them a place to find help.</FP>
  <FP>Through the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, my Administration has been working to meet a goal of being able to prevent and effectively treat this illness by 2025. Over the past year we have taken a number of actions to reach this vision, including developing a training curriculum that gives health care workers the necessary skills to care for dementia patients and better detect and diagnose dementia. We have also helped family caregivers look after their own health, in addition to addressing the needs of people with dementia, and launched a campaign to increase awareness of changes in the brain as people age so that older adults feel more comfortable having open conversations with family members and health care providers.</FP>

  <FP>In addition to ensuring anyone with Alzheimer's can access proper care, we must harness the innovative ideas of the scientific community and work to prevent this disease. To ramp up research and development aimed at uncovering the answers to diseases like Alzheimer's, I have increased funding for research dedicated to understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer's and related dementias. I also introduced the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, which will enhance our understanding of brain function and give scientists the tools they need to better understand and discover new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders. And through a bold new research effort that seeks to deliver personalized care through patient-centered research and collaboration, my Precision Medicine Initiative is working to revolutionize our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's.<PRTPAGE P="320"/>

  <FP>From researchers and advocates who are bringing us closer to preventing this disease to family members who devotedly look after their loved ones, people across our country are doing their part to support those touched by Alzheimer's. This month, let us honor those we have lost too soon and renew our efforts to ensure more Americans can live their lives with health and happiness.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about Alzheimer's disease and support the individuals living with this disease and their caregivers.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Entrepreneurship Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Entrepreneurs in America have long lent their talents and passions to solving problems, generating growth and prosperity, and turning dreams into new goods and services for people across our Nation and around the world. During National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate the entrepreneurs who serve their communities and bolster our economy, and we pledge our support for them in their pursuit of the ideas and innovations of tomorrow.</FP>

  <FP>Through their intrepid sense of possibility and resilience, and their unwillingness to give in or give up, entrepreneurs from every walk of life make invaluable contributions to the American experience—turning bold ideas into real progress. My Administration has made it a priority from day one to support those who take a risk and put in the hard work required to get a new venture off the ground. In 2010, I signed the Affordable Care Act, which gives Americans greater opportunities to start businesses by offering portable and affordable health insurance plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. I signed 18 tax breaks for small businesses in my first term, including tax credits for those who hire unemployed workers and veterans, and I launched the Nation of Makers initiative to advance innovation and encourage making, including homegrown technologies and startups. In 2013, I signed an Executive Order to make Government data more accessible to the public, and my Administration has opened up nearly 200,000 datasets on www.Data.gov to fuel economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And earlier this year, I announced the Computer Science for All Initiative—a plan to give all students in America the chance to learn computer science in school, which will equip our future entrepreneurs, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, with the computational thinking skills they need to succeed.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>
  </FP>

  <FP>In the 21st-century economy—where business does not stop at a country's border and where technological advancements have changed the ways we engage in commerce and with one another—it is more important than ever that we give our Nation's entrepreneurs the tools and resources they need to compete on the international stage. This past summer, I signed an Executive Order that encourages entrepreneurship in the United States and around the world, including through the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship Program, to promote the sharing of knowledge and experience with the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Additionally, as I attended the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in California in June, companies across America came together to sign the Tech Inclusion Pledge: a commitment to making their technology workforces more representative of the American people. My Administration also used this Summit as an opportunity to announce an expansion of the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps training program for entrepreneurial scientists and engineers, as well as the Small Business Administration's <E T="03">Startup in a Day</E> initiative, with nearly 100 cities and communities across our Nation committed to streamlining licensing, permitting, and other requirements necessary for anyone to start a business. At the end of last year, I signed a bipartisan budget deal that made permanent critical tax incentives to help bolster investment in small businesses and research and experimentation, including by startups and other innovative companies. And thanks to another bipartisan bill I signed, entrepreneurs can raise small-dollar investments from community members, customers, and other individuals through new and regulated online crowdfunding platforms—because access to capital should be available to every aspiring entrepreneur no matter who they are or where they are from.</FP>
  <FP>My Administration has also striven to expand opportunity to those seeking to utilize their entrepreneurial talents abroad. Following the beginning of our process to normalize relations with our neighbors 90 miles to the south in Cuba, we made it easier for Cuban entrepreneurs to import and export. Entrepreneurs flourish when they are surrounded by an environment that encourages their success—that is true here at home and around the world. My Administration remains committed to implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that will have a profound effect on our efforts to support online entrepreneurs and enable American entrepreneurs to sell “Made in America” products all over the world. And through our proposed International Entrepreneur Rule, we are working to ensure the world's best and brightest entrepreneurs can launch companies and create jobs in the United States.</FP>

  <FP>As we celebrate National Entrepreneurship Month and Global Entrepreneurship Week, let us resolve to support those budding entrepreneurs looking to use their ideas and expertise to build a better life for themselves and their families—and let us tap into the diverse skills and talents across our country so that entrepreneurs from all backgrounds can continue creating the businesses of the 21st century. Entrepreneurship is about the opportunity to forge one's own future, and an investment in that future can start as something small and turn into something great. That is the legacy shaped by generations of American entrepreneurs who, through ingenuity, passion, and self-determination, have always striven to achieve the next big, unknown thing.<PRTPAGE P="322"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Family Caregivers Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation was founded on the fundamental ideal that we all do better when we look out for one another, and every day, millions of Americans from every walk of life balance their own needs with those of their loved ones as caregivers. During National Family Caregivers Month, we reaffirm our support for those who give of themselves to be there for their family, friends, and neighbors in challenging times, and we pledge to carry forward the progress we have made in our health care system and workplaces to give caregivers the resources and flexibility they need.</FP>
  <FP>Each of us may find ourselves in need of or providing care at some point in our lives. That is why it is imperative that we maintain and expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At the time Medicare was created, only a little more than half of all seniors had some form of health insurance. Today, the ACA has given older Americans better care and more access to discounted prescriptions and certain preventive services at no cost. The ACA has also expanded options for home- and community-based services, so that, with the help of devoted, loving caregivers, more Americans are now able to live independently and with dignity. And because looking after an aging family member or a friend with a disability can be challenging, States and local agencies connect individuals with caregiver support groups and respite care. The women and men who put their loved ones before themselves show incredible generosity every day, and we must continue to support them in every task they selflessly carry out.</FP>

  <FP>Many devoted caregivers across our country also attend to members of our Armed Forces when they return home, and my Administration is committed to improving the care and support our veterans and their families receive. For over 5 years, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's <E T="03">Joining Forces</E> initiative has worked to ensure those who look after our service members who come home with the wounds of war—whether they are visible or not—have the community and Government support they need to help their siblings and spouses, parents and children, neighbors and friends through one of the greatest battles they may face: the fight to recover and heal.<PRTPAGE P="323"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>This month, and every month, let us lift up all those who work to tirelessly advance the health and wellness of those they love. Let us encourage those who choose to be caregivers and look toward a future where our politics and our policies reflect the selflessness and open-hearted empathy they show their loved ones every day.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay tribute to those who provide for the health and well-being of their family members, friends, and neighbors.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Native American Heritage Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>As the First Americans, Native Americans have helped shape the future of the United States through every turn of our history. Today, young American Indians and Alaska Natives embrace open-ended possibility and are determining their own destinies. During National Native American Heritage Month, we pledge to maintain the meaningful partnerships we have with tribal nations, and we renew our commitment to our nation-to-nation relationships as we seek to give all our children the future they deserve.</FP>
  <FP>Over our long shared history, there have been too many unfortunate chapters of pain and tragedy, discrimination and injustice. We must acknowledge that history while recognizing that the future is still ours to write. That is why my Administration remains dedicated to strengthening our government-to-government relationships with tribal nations and working to improve the lives of all our people. Three years ago, I issued an Executive Order establishing the White House Council on Native American Affairs to help ensure the Federal Government engages in true and lasting relationships with tribes and promotes the development of prosperous and resilient tribal communities. Last month, I hosted the eighth Tribal Nations Conference and brought tribal leaders together to identify key issues we still face. We have worked to better protect sacred lands and restored many acres of tribal homelands, as well as supported greater representation of indigenous peoples before the United Nations and called for further implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. And we have taken steps to strengthen tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters, including through the Tribal Law and Order Act.</FP>

  <FP>Through the Affordable Care Act and permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, we empowered more Native Americans <PRTPAGE P="324"/>to access the quality health care they need to live full, healthy lives. Throughout their lives, 84 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls will experience some form of violence, and in 2013, I signed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which allows tribes to prosecute non-Native individuals who commit acts of domestic violence in Indian Country. And through the North American Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls, we are strengthening regional coordination on the rights of women and girls from indigenous communities across the continent.</FP>
  <FP>In recognition of the immeasurable contributions that Native Americans have made to our Nation, we continue to advocate for expanding opportunity across Indian Country. We have supported tribal colleges and universities and worked to return control of education to tribal nations—not only to prepare Native youth for the demands of future employment, but also to promote their own tribal languages and cultures. We are investing in job training and clean-energy projects, infrastructure, and high-speed internet that connects Native American communities to the broader economy. We are connecting more young people and fostering a national dialogue to empower the next generation of Native leaders through the Generation Indigenous initiative. Through www.NativeOneStop.gov, we have also worked to improve coordination and access to Federal services throughout Indian Country. Indian Country still faces many challenges, but we have made significant progress together since I took office, and we must never give up on our pursuit of the ever brighter future that lies ahead.</FP>
  <FP>This month, let us celebrate the traditions, languages, and stories of Native Americans and ensure their rich histories and contributions can thrive with each passing generation. Let us continue to build on the advancements we have made, because enduring progress will depend on our dedication to honoring our trust and treaty responsibilities. With sustained effort and unwavering optimism, we can ensure a vibrant and resilient Indian Country filled with possibility and prosperity.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to celebrate November 25, 2016, as Native American Heritage Day.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World Freedom Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>The Berlin Wall stood in the city it divided for nearly 30 years, separating families and loved ones and embodying the authoritarianism that reigned in Communist states throughout the Cold War. On November 9, 1989, with the courage of their convictions and a longing to forge their own destinies, Germans from both the East and West sides of the Wall celebrated history as a defining symbol of the Iron Curtain collapsed. Twenty-seven years later, we pay tribute to the unyielding determination of those who chose unity over division, and we rededicate ourselves to carrying this spirit forward wherever core tenets of democracy and liberty are at stake.</FP>
  <FP>When President John F. Kennedy declared in West Berlin that “when one man is enslaved, all are not free,” he captured the irrevocable truth of the work that remains to this day. Our world is more prosperous and free than at any time in our history, with more people than ever before choosing their leaders through free elections and living in democracies with greater respect for human rights. But such liberty will not emerge across the globe in a single wave—building strong, democratic institutions and maintaining robust civil societies is the work of generations, and it is up to each of us to put our shoulders to the wheel of progress and fight for the future we seek. Whether in quiet struggle or boisterous protest, the Berliners who endured the division the Berlin Wall created and stood for remind us of the necessity to never abandon the values that have brought us as far as we are today.</FP>
  <FP>For centuries, people of every nation have borne witness to great strife and tension in our ever-changing world—but we have proven we can always choose a better course through our relentless pursuit of freedom. Across oceans and continents, in recognition of World Freedom Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to carrying forward the enduring celebration of liberty that defined the fall of the Berlin Wall.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2016, as World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our dedication to freedom and democracy.</FP>

  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>America has long stood as a beacon of hope and opportunity, and few embody that spirit here at home and beyond our borders more than the members of our Armed Forces. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen are part of an unbroken chain of brave patriots who have served our country with honor and made tremendous sacrifices so that we may live free. On Veterans Day, we salute the women and men who have proudly worn the uniform of the United States of America and the families who have served alongside them, and we affirm our sacred duty as citizens to express our enduring gratitude, both in words and in actions, for their service.</FP>
  <FP>Our country has the best-trained and best-equipped military force in the world, and we need to make sure we have the most supported and respected veterans in the world. We are a Nation that leaves no one behind, and my Administration has made historic investments to provide veterans access to the resources and education they need to share in our Nation's promise when they return home. Partnering with community leaders across America, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative works to ensure our country's heroes can thrive by combatting veteran homelessness, promoting their emotional well-being, and advancing employment training and placement—and we have made great progress. Today, the unemployment rate for veterans is lower than the national average, and veteran homelessness has been nearly cut in half since 2010. We also recognize that some of these courageous men and women have faced and overcome profound challenges, both physically and emotionally, in defense of our freedom. We must continue to provide high quality health care to our veterans and make sure they have the support they have earned and deserve.</FP>
  <FP>The example our Nation's veterans set throughout their lives is a testament to the drive and perseverance that define the American character. Let us uphold our obligations to these heroic individuals and never forget those who paid the ultimate price for our liberty. On this day and throughout the year, may we sustain their lasting contributions to our Nation's progress and carry forward their legacy by building a future that is stronger, safer, and freer for all.</FP>
  <FP>With respect for, and in recognition of, the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2016, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers, and by observing 2 minutes of silence for our Nation's veterans. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">American Education Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>With great potential to prepare our young people for the world they will inherit and lead, education provides one of the most essential foundations for prosperity and opportunity, strengthening our democracy and civic life and serving as a pathway to economic success. It helps cultivate passion and inspire young people to build and create; analyze and discover; understand and empathize with the people around them, and through education, students can form a deeper understanding of history and society, literature and languages, and how things work and why they do. During American Education Week, we recognize the importance of education and renew our commitment to bringing a better education within reach for all our people.</FP>
  <FP>America's high school graduation rate is now the highest ever recorded, and the hard work people across our country have put in is paying off. States have set higher, better standards to help us out-teach and out-compete other nations. Teachers are going that extra mile to create meaningful and memorable lessons, rather than merely teaching to a test, and we have given them more flexibility to do so through the Every Student Succeeds Act—a bipartisan bill I signed last year to improve schools, give State and local lawmakers more control, and target resources to where they are needed most. But across our country, there are unfortunately still too many places where we can do far better for our students. Too many schools are underfunded and lack the resources or structures they need to prepare students for success, and for far too many students, their zip codes still determine how far they can go.</FP>

  <FP>From strengthening high-quality early education and preschool to bolstering access to higher education, my Administration has made improving our education system a priority for our students from their first days of school to the days they start their careers. Nobody should be priced out of a higher education, so we are striving to make college more affordable and provide 2 years of free community college for any student willing to work for it. We also reformed the student loan system and expanded Pell grants to more students. The demands of our global economy and changing technology require students to learn real-world skills such as computer science in the classroom, so we are bringing new technology and digital tools, including high-speed internet, into classrooms to modernize education. And because too many girls, young people of color, and low-income students <PRTPAGE P="328"/>are not encouraged and underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses and careers, we are investing in ways to broaden STEM participation as well as working to train more STEM teachers.</FP>
  <FP>Empowering students of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs to challenge themselves to reach higher, education can lift up a generation, allowing them to carry the torch of progress forward and make our world a better place. This week, let us recommit to the important work that remains and ensure every student in America can access the support, resources, and opportunities they need to thrive.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by supporting their local schools and educators through appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to help create opportunities for every school and student in America.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Since their discovery nearly nine decades ago, antibiotics have transformed the world of modern medicine. They have been instrumental in combating previously deadly or debilitating illnesses and have saved countless lives. Yet the misuse of antibiotics can pose risks to public health. As antibiotics have become more commonly prescribed and misused in all health care settings, bacteria have developed the capability to resist them, which can undermine their effectiveness. Get Smart About Antibiotics Week is an important opportunity to highlight the need to use antibiotics responsibly.</FP>

  <FP>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause tens of thousands of deaths each year in the United States alone, and millions of Americans contract antibiotic-resistant illnesses that are difficult and expensive to treat. A major factor contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistance is the inappropriate use of antibiotics, which are among the most frequently prescribed medicines and are also given to animals that are used for food. When a person takes antibiotics for a bacterial infection, bacteria sensitive to that medicine are generally destroyed or prevented from growing further—but bacteria that are resistant to that antibiotic will multiply, making current or future bacterial infections even worse and harder to treat. When antibiotics are used inappropriately, including when they are not needed—such as for treating viral infections like the common cold, or used in wrong doses or for the <PRTPAGE P="329"/>wrong period of time—the likelihood of antibiotic resistance is greatly increased, reducing the effectiveness of these antibiotics in the future. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infections cost our country tens of billions of dollars in health care expenses, but more importantly, if we lose effective antibiotic options for treating people, more patients will be put at risk—unless we act now.</FP>
  <FP>That is why my Administration has taken action to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and help ensure the continued availability of effective therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infections. In 2014, I signed an Executive Order that created the Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, established an interagency approach to improve our Nation's antibiotic use, and built a framework to strengthen surveillance systems so important data on antibiotic-resistant bacteria can more easily be shared and tracked to prevent and control infections. We also launched the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, through which we are working to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and accelerate research efforts to develop alternative treatments, diagnostic tools, and vaccines. Last year, with recognition that our public health is connected to the health of animals and the environment, especially with regards to the spread of disease, we hosted the White House Forum on Antibiotic Stewardship to bring together key human and animal health stakeholders to identify successful strategies and opportunities for collaboration. We must continue working with food producers, health care providers, leaders in the private sector, and the American people to improve our antibiotic use.</FP>
  <FP>With a sustained commitment to promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics, we can address this growing public health problem. In September, the United Nations General Assembly pledged their commitment to international cooperation to combat this global threat to human health, development, and security, and heads of states came together to commit to initiating, increasing, and sustaining awareness of antimicrobial resistance. This week, we resolve to improve awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance to our public health, and we encourage medical professionals to prescribe, and patients to use, antibiotics responsibly. Let us ensure that future generations can access safe and effective antibiotics, and together let us address the harmful effects of antibiotic resistance.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as Get Smart About Antibiotics Week. I call upon the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, industry leaders, and all Americans to observe this week by promoting the responsible use of antibiotics and raising awareness of the dangers inherent in their misuse and overuse.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Apprenticeship Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>When I took office, our economy was in freefall—millions of Americans lost their jobs and paid the price of the worst recession of our time. But with grit and determination, our people fought their way back and began working to rebuild an economy that works for everyone. Although we have added more than 15 million jobs in the last 6 years, too many people are still feeling left behind in our 21st-century economy. And because the jobs of today and tomorrow require more advanced skills and training, apprenticeship programs play an increasingly important role in helping people succeed in the workforce. This week, we celebrate the ways this job-driven training model prepares Americans for meaningful employment, and we resolve to expand access to this essential pathway to opportunity.</FP>
  <FP>Registered apprenticeships connect job-seekers to better paying jobs that are in high demand, and by providing hands-on experiences and allowing Americans to earn while they learn, they help workers gain the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in our modern economy. More than 90 percent of apprentices find employment after completing their programs, with graduates earning an average starting salary over $60,000. In addition to benefitting employees, apprenticeship programs also help employers by increasing productivity and innovation with a high return on investment. A variety of industries—from healthcare to construction to information technology and advanced manufacturing—are using apprenticeship programs to meet their workforce needs. To bolster the competitiveness of those industries and others, it is imperative that our Nation continues investing in apprenticeship programs. Across our country, State and local leaders have done just that—in some cases expanding apprenticeships by over 20 percent in their regions. And since 2014, 290 colleges have joined in the effort to offer college credit toward a degree for completing apprenticeship programs.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration applauds these widespread efforts and remains committed to supporting apprenticeship programs. Two years ago, I announced a goal to double the number of registered apprenticeships, and with 125,000 more active apprenticeships today than in 2014, we have seen the largest 3-year increase in nearly a decade. We invested unprecedented levels of Federal funding in apprenticeships, including recently awarding more than $50 million in new grants to States through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative. This year, we also invested over $20 million to start new apprenticeship programs and help historically underrepresented individuals—including women, minorities, and people with disabilities—access apprenticeship programs. Last year, I signed the first-ever annual Federal funding for apprenticeship programs into law, and I will keep calling on the Congress to continue funding these efforts so that this work is carried forward for years to come. And because those who have served our country in uniform deserve every opportunity to enjoy the American dream they helped defend, we are working to provide assistance <PRTPAGE P="331"/>to service members and veterans who seek to enter registered apprenticeship programs.</FP>
  <FP>During National Apprenticeship Week, employers, sponsors, and leaders across our country will host open houses to highlight the significant value of apprenticeships in our economy. Let us encourage more employers to offer—and more workers to take advantage of—these indispensable learning and training opportunities, and together let us continue working to equip the American workforce to meet the demands of an ever changing future so it is filled with prosperity and opportunity for all who are willing to work for it.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as National Apprenticeship Week.

  <FP>Recycling is a process that allows materials that would otherwise be thrown out to be manufactured into new materials that can be used again. By decreasing landfill waste and conserving important natural resources, recycling can mitigate pollution, save energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many items such as paper, plastics, and batteries are commonly known to be recyclable, but many other products—including oil and tires—can also be recycled. In addition to helping reduce our environmental footprint, recycling also strengthens our economy and creates hundreds of thousands of green jobs. To learn more about what can be recycled and ways to encourage recycling in your community, visit www.EPA.gov/Recycle.</FP>

  <FP>People of all ages can do their part by reducing waste and reusing items. In our homes we can compost food and yard waste rather than sending it <PRTPAGE P="332"/>to a landfill; in schools we can utilize reusable containers for storing lunches and school supplies; and in workplaces we can print more documents double-sided and on recycled paper, or opt for digital copies rather than printing in the first place. The Federal Government is doing our part to lead by example—from helping businesses purchase recycled materials to assisting grocery stores, schools, and stadiums with reducing their food waste, we are striving to give businesses, States, and local governments the resources they need to encourage recycling across our Nation.</FP>
  <FP>One of the most important things we can do with our time on Earth is to make it better for future generations. On America Recycles Day, we renew our commitment to making environmentally conscious changes in our lives so that our children and grandchildren can live that better, cleaner future. Let us continue striving to reduce waste, conserve resources, and meet our obligations to our planet and to future generations.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2016, as America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their reducing, reusing, and recycling efforts throughout the year.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Family Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Through every passing generation, families have formed the backbone of our society. With pride, passion, and a commitment to their loved ones, family members give of themselves to create opportunities they never had and forge a brighter future for themselves and their children. This week, we honor the families who have built the America we know today and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring every family can have their chance at a fair shot.</FP>

  <FP>Nobody should have to choose between spending time with their family and financially supporting them, and my Administration has prioritized efforts to strengthen families and address the challenges we face in our workforce. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate has never been lower, and more families have been able to get quality, affordable health care. But there is more work to be done. The United States is the only advanced country that does not guarantee paid family or sick leave, and too often, American workers have to make painful choices about whether they <PRTPAGE P="333"/>can afford to be there when their families need them most. Workers also deserve fair work schedules that ensure predictability and certainty. And women should be paid the same as men for doing the same jobs—a principle that is not just fair and ethical, but also necessary because more women are their family's main breadwinners than ever before.</FP>
  <FP>We all have a role to play in lifting up families, and the Federal Government is leading by example. To help give more families the comfort of safe and nurturing child care, my Administration published a new rule earlier this year to strengthen quality, health, and safety standards for child care programs. Earlier this year, I took action to expand overtime protections to more than 4 million workers, and because no one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty, I have called on the Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage—in the meantime, cities, States, and businesses across our country have taken action, answering the call to raise the minimum wage and helping American families everywhere.</FP>
  <FP>Families of every race, religion, and background have written America's story and embodied our founding notion: that out of many, we are one. Adoptive and foster families open their hearts and their homes to welcome children in need, patriotic military families sacrifice precious time with their loved ones to give us the opportunity to be with ours, and last year, the families of gay and lesbian couples who fought so long for basic civil rights were finally recognized as equal under the law.</FP>
  <FP>Through challenging moments and difficult times, America's families are representative of the strength and unity at the core of our communities. Their love is an enduring reminder of what is best about our country. This week, let us celebrate the devotion of dedicated family members across our Nation and pledge to give them the support they need to thrive.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20 through November 26, 2016, as National Family Week. I invite all States, communities, and individuals to join in observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Child's Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>No matter what zip code they are born into, every young child in America deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and realize their dreams in a safe and healthy environment. From ensuring they are cared for and nourished <PRTPAGE P="334"/>to helping them become educated participants in our democracy, we must all do our part to support the next generation of leaders. Today, let us lift up every child in need and strive to leave behind a world that we are proud of for children across our country.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration has worked to put children in every community on a path to a healthier future. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's <E T="03">Let's Move!</E> initiative, we have fostered environments that support healthy choices, promote physical activity, and reduce childhood obesity. We have also fought to improve Head Start and expand quality, affordable child care, which promotes healthy development and school readiness in young children and helps families be more financially secure at home. Because of the broader coverage expansions made possible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and improvements made to the Children's Health Insurance Plan through legislation I signed during my first month in office, more than 3 million children have gotten health insurance and the uninsured rate among children has fallen by almost half since 2008. And because of the ACA, children can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. They can also remain on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26, and all plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace are now required to cover basic pediatric services. Anyone who is in need of health insurance can visit www.HealthCare.gov to find coverage for themselves and their children. You can also visit www.Medicaid.gov to find out if you qualify for coverage through Medicaid.</FP>
  <FP>It is one of our greatest obligations to create cleaner and safer environments for our children to live in. Not only must we protect our planet against climate change and secure it for future generations, but we must continue taking concrete action to reduce the effects that dirty air and water can impose on our children—such as the potential for higher incidence of asthma attacks. We must also work to keep our children safe from violence and abuse, prevent youth substance use and its consequences, and modernize our juvenile justice system to hold youth accountable for their actions without consigning them to a never-ending cycle of incarceration.</FP>
  <FP>We know that when we invest in young children, the outcomes are significant—and by investing in early education and preschool for all, we can set children up for success later in life. Education has the potential to unlock ladders of opportunity and empower children to pursue their passions, and we must continue working to strengthen our Nation's education system for children at every grade level. That is why my Administration has pursued efforts to bring higher education within reach for more students and make college more affordable.</FP>
  <FP>Our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for, cherished, and safe from harm. On National Child's Day, let us forge a future of greater opportunity and prosperity for every young person, and let us seek to reach our greatest potential as a Nation by ensuring our daughters and sons can live up to theirs.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2016, as National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies, and to rededicate ourselves to creating the bright future we want for our Nation's children.<PRTPAGE P="335"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Thanksgiving Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Nearly 400 years ago, a small band of Pilgrims fled persecution and violence and came to this land as refugees in search of opportunity and the freedom to practice their faith. Though the journey was rough and their first winter harsh, the friendly embrace of an indigenous people, the Wampanoag—who offered gracious lessons in agriculture and crop production—led to their successful first harvest. The Pilgrims were grateful they could rely on the generosity of the Wampanoag people, without whom they would not have survived their first year in the new land, and together they celebrated this bounty with a festival that lasted for days and prompted the tradition of an annual day of giving thanks.</FP>
  <FP>This history teaches us that the American instinct has never been to seek isolation in opposite corners; it is to find strength in our common creed and forge unity from our great diversity. On that very first thanksgiving celebration, these same ideals brought together people of different backgrounds and beliefs, and every year since, with enduring confidence in the power of faith, love, gratitude, and optimism, this force of unity has sustained us as a people. It has guided us through times of great challenge and change and allowed us to see ourselves in those who come to our shores in search of a safer, better future for themselves and their families.</FP>
  <FP>On this holiday, we count our blessings and renew our commitment to giving back. We give thanks for our troops and our veterans—and their families—who give of themselves to protect the values we cherish; for the first responders, teachers, and engaged Americans who serve their communities; and for the chance to live in a country founded on the belief that all of us are created equal. But on this day of gratitude, we are also reminded that securing these freedoms and opportunities for all our people is an unfinished task. We must reflect on all we have been afforded while continuing the work of ensuring no one is left out or left behind because of who they are or where they come from.</FP>

  <FP>For generations, our Nation's progress has been carried forward by those who act on the obligations we have to one another. Each year on Thanksgiving, the selflessness and decency of the American people surface in food banks and shelters across our country, in time spent caring for the sick and the stranger, and in efforts to empathize with those with whom we disagree and to recognize that every individual is worthy of compassion and care. As we gather in the company of our friends, families, and communities—just as the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag did centuries ago—let us strive to <PRTPAGE P="336"/>lift up others, promote tolerance and inclusiveness, and give thanks for the joy and love that surround all of us.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 24, 2016, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the United States to join together—whether in our homes, places of worship, community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and neighbors—and give thanks for all we have received in the past year, express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and share our bounty with others.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Driving drunk, drugged, or distracted poses a significant threat to drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and all who share our roads. During the holiday season, incidents of impaired driving occur more frequently, and every December, we observe National Impaired Driving Prevention Month to highlight steps we can take to improve safety on our streets and raise awareness of these preventable dangers.</FP>
  <FP>Recently, the number of traffic crash fatalities caused by impaired driving has unfortunately increased—last year, preventable alcohol-related driving fatalities accounted for nearly one-third of all traffic fatalities. Consumption of alcohol by drivers, even those who are of legal drinking age, is highly dangerous, and drug use, including prescription drug use, can also harm judgment, perception, and the motor skills used when driving. Distracted driving—including eating, tending to passengers, and using a cell phone—can also be dangerous and is equally preventable.</FP>
  <FP>We can all do our part to keep our roads safe and prevent these tragedies. As passengers, we can reduce our interactions with drivers and lessen distractions. As friends and family members, we can look out for loved ones who may be drinking and help them get home safely. And as citizens, we can always call 911 to report any dangerous driving we observe.</FP>

  <FP>My Administration has worked to help Americans who struggle with substance use disorders and substance misuse, which can lead to incidents of drunk or drugged driving. We are also striving to give law enforcement officers the resources and support they need to combat impaired driving, and we must encourage the development of technologies like ignition interlock devices, which can prevent impaired individuals from getting behind the wheel. Through the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign, States and <PRTPAGE P="337"/>communities across our country are working to increase road patrols and sobriety checkpoints, in addition to raising awareness and improving education on the dangers of impaired driving. You can learn more about what we are doing to prevent impaired driving by visiting www.WhiteHouse.gov/ONDCP/DruggedDriving, www.NHTSA.gov/DriveSober, and www.Distraction.gov.</FP>
  <FP>Whether encouraging parents to set a good example for their teen drivers or educating every driver on the dangers of unsafe driving, we must recommit to doing everything we can to prevent driving-related injuries and fatalities. This month, let us continue empowering drivers to make responsible decisions and educating the American people on ways they can help keep our roads safe and our futures bright.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2016 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">World AIDS Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Thirty-five years ago the first documented cases of AIDS brought about an era of uncertainty, fear, and discrimination. HIV/AIDS has taken tens of millions of lives—and far too many people with HIV have struggled to get the care, treatment, and compassion they deserve. But in the decades since those first cases, with ingenuity, leadership, research, and historic investments in evidence-based practices, we have begun to move toward an era of resilience and hope—and we are closer than ever to reaching an AIDS-free generation. On World AIDS Day, we join with the international community to remember those we have lost too soon, reflect on the tremendous progress we have made in battling this disease, and carry forward our fight against HIV/AIDS.</FP>

  <FP>By shining a light on this issue and educating more communities about the importance of testing and treatment, we have saved and improved lives. Although we have come far in recent decades, our work is not yet done and the urgency to intervene in this epidemic is critical. In the United States, more than 1.2 million people are living with HIV. Gay and bisexual men, transgender people, youth, black and Latino Americans, people living in the Southern United States, and people who inject drugs are at a disproportionate risk. People living with HIV can face stigma and discrimination, creating barriers to prevention and treatment services.<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>My Administration has made significant efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, including by encouraging treatment as prevention, expanding access to pre-exposure prophylaxis, eliminating waiting lists for medication assistance programs, and working toward a vaccine. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions like HIV, and millions of people can now access quality, affordable health insurance plans that cover important services like HIV testing and screening. In 2010, I introduced the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the United States, and last year, through an Executive Order, I updated it to serve as a guiding path to 2020. This update builds on the primary goals of the original Strategy, including reducing the number of HIV-infected individuals and HIV-related health disparities, improving health outcomes for anyone living with HIV and increasing their access to care, and strengthening our coordinated national response to this epidemic.</FP>
  <FP>Currently, more than 36 million people, including 1.8 million children, are living with HIV/AIDS across the globe, and the majority of people living with HIV reside in low- to middle-income countries. We need to do more to reach those who are at risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, and the United States is helping shape the world's response to this crisis and working alongside the international community to end this epidemic by 2030. We have strengthened and expanded the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with now more than $70 billion invested, to accelerate our progress and work to control this epidemic with comprehensive and data-focused efforts. With PEPFAR support for more than 11 million people on life-saving treatment and through contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria—including a new pledge of more than $4 billion through 2019—there are now more than 18 million people getting HIV treatment and care. Because in sub-Saharan Africa young women and adolescent girls are over eight times more likely to get HIV/AIDS than young men, we launched a comprehensive prevention program to reduce HIV infections among this population in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. This summer, PEPFAR established an innovative investment fund to expand access to quality HIV/AIDS services for key populations affected by the epidemic and reduce the stigma and discrimination that persists. We have also helped prevent millions of new infections worldwide, including in more than 1.5 million babies of HIV-positive mothers who were born free of HIV. By translating groundbreaking research and scientific tools into action, for the first time we are seeing early but promising signs of controlling the spread of HIV.</FP>
  <FP>Accelerating the progress we have made will require sustained commitment and passion from every sector of society and across every level of government around the world. A future where no individual has to suffer from HIV/AIDS is within our reach, and today, we recommit to ensuring the next generation has the tools they need to continue fighting this disease. Let us strive to support all people living with HIV/AIDS and rededicate ourselves to ending this epidemic once and for all. Together, we can achieve what once seemed impossible and give more people the chance at a longer, brighter, AIDS-free future.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2016, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth <PRTPAGE P="339"/>of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and compassion to those living with HIV.</FP>

Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, implemented amendments to sections 112(b)(3)(A) and 112(c)(1) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(A) and 3721(c)(1)), as amended by sections 103(b)(2) and 103(b)(3) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (TPEA) (Public Law 114-27). That proclamation, in part, modified the HTS to extend the regional apparel article program and the third-country fabric program through September 30, 2025. These modifications to the HTS included certain technical errors. I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct the technical errors.</FP>

  <FP>14. Executive Order 13742 of October 7, 2016, authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) and the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq</E>.), revoked the ban on the importation into the United States of any jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from Burma and any articles of jewelry containing jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from Burma. Presidential Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015, previously modified the HTS to include additional U.S. Note 4 to Chapter 71 of the HTS, which prohibited the importation of any jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from Burma and any articles of jewelry containing jadeite or rubies mined or extracted from Burma. Importation of those products was previously prohibited under the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (the “BFDA”) (Public Law 108-61), as amended by section 6(a) of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 (the “JADE Act”) (Public Law 110-286), before its expiration on July 28, 2013. I have determined that the deletion of additional U.S. Note 4 to Chapter 71 of the HTS is necessary to the implementation of Executive Order 13742.</FP>

  <FP>15. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the <E T="03">Federal Register</E>.</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9550</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Over a quarter-century ago, the United States enshrined into law the principles of equal access and equal opportunity for people with disabilities through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which upholds the principle that each of us is entitled to a set of fundamental freedoms and protections. This progress has made America a leader in advancing the rights of people with disabilities around the globe. On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we celebrate how far we have come in protecting the rights of those who live with disabilities and recommit to shaping a future in which all members of this community can enjoy their full rights and freedoms.</FP>
  <FP>Building on the progress of the ADA, my Administration has taken important steps to remove barriers and eliminate discrimination based on disability. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, individuals can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition or disability. We have supported increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, and strengthened anti-discrimination and Olmstead enforcement at the Department of Justice. Additionally, we created the first-ever Special Advisor for International Disability Rights, and we established the United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally in order to address violence against women and girls around the world—because women with a disability are more likely to experience physical and sexual abuse than women without one. And last year, we committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which recognize inclusive education, disability employment, and social acceptance of the disability community as important steps to ending world poverty.</FP>

  <FP>Our progress at home reflects our full commitment to the rights of people with disabilities around the world. America was the first country to comprehensively address non-discrimination on the basis of disability in national legislation and declare that disability rights are human rights which must be recognized and promoted everywhere. In my first year in office, the United States joined 140 other nations in signing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities—the first international human rights convention to fully address human rights in the context of disability. Now joined by over 160 States Parties, this Convention serves as a beacon of hope to the more than 1 billion people worldwide who live with a disability—a reminder that the need to protect disability <PRTPAGE P="347"/>rights does not end at our borders. Regrettably, the Senate has still not provided its advice and consent for ratification of this Convention, and I urge them to do so and to uphold our global commitment to the international disability community.</FP>
  <FP>We have taken important steps forward to advance the rights of persons with disabilities, but the fight is not over. As long as anyone succumbs to casual discrimination or fear of the unfamiliar, we have more work to do to honor the many people with disabilities who have shared their stories of exclusion and injustice—and the millions more they spoke up for. Because of the advocates who have led the way, more individuals with disabilities can pursue their full measure of happiness. They have taught us that our world is far better off when all people can live up to their full potential—it makes all of us more whole, and it makes our world a better place.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2016, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Seventy-five years ago, Japanese fighter planes attacked the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor, destroying much of our Pacific Fleet and killing more than 2,400 Americans. The following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on the Congress to declare war and “make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.” In that spirit, Americans came together to pay tribute to the victims, support the survivors, and shed the comforts of civilian life to serve in our military and fight for our Union. Each year on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor those whose lives were forever changed that December morning and resolve to uphold the legacy of all who stepped forward in our time of need.</FP>

  <FP>From the docks of Pearl Harbor to the beaches of Normandy and far around the world, brave patriots served their country and defended the values that have sustained our Nation since its founding. They went to war for liberty and sacrificed more than most of us will ever know; they chased victory and defeated fascism, turning adversaries into allies and writing a new chapter in our history. Through their service and unparalleled devotion, they inspired a generation with their refusal to give in despite overwhelming odds. And as we reflect on the profound debt of gratitude we <PRTPAGE P="348"/>owe them for the freedoms we cherish, we are reminded of the everlasting responsibilities we have to one another and to our country.</FP>
  <FP>In memory of all who lost their lives on December 7, 1941—and those who responded by leaving their homes for the battlefields—we must ensure the sacrifices they made in the name of liberty and democracy were not made in vain. On this solemn anniversary, there can be no higher tribute to these American patriots than forging a united commitment to honor our troops and veterans, give them the support and care they deserve, and carry on their work of keeping our country strong and free.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.”</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2016, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted on December 10, 1948, it set in motion a movement to secure liberty and justice for all people. Out of the ashes of the Second World War, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed that “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, we reflect on how far we have come in upholding these universal rights and resolve to continue fighting to safeguard them wherever they are threatened.</FP>
  <FP>In the last few decades, our world has made great strides in advancing human rights and the institutions that protect them. More countries have pursued self-government and democracy—and more people are electing their leaders freely and fairly and holding their governments accountable through calls for increased transparency. Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere.</FP>
  <FP>History ultimately moves in the direction of justice and inclusion, but despite the great progress we have made, unprecedented and rapid change has posed great challenges. It is our collective duty to continue striving for a world where nobody is left behind, forgotten, or mistreated, and where all nations recognize that societies that draw on the contributions of every citizen are stronger. Far too many people around the world are still denied their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we must work to end the discrimination that is too often felt by LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, immigrants, women and girls of all ages, and members of religious, ethnic, and other minorities. And we must strengthen our ongoing efforts to rid the world of violence, oppression, and hatred.</FP>
  <FP>Our relationships to one another—person to person, nation to nation—are defined not by our differences, but by our shared belief in the ideals enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As we observe the anniversary of the affirmation that inalienable rights exist for every individual, we vow to ensure these rights are afforded to every person. Together, let us continue striving to stamp out all forms of injustice and promote dignity, humanity, and respect around the world.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2016, as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2016, as Human Rights Week.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Bill of Rights Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>After much debate and deliberation among the Framers, the first 10 Amendments to our Constitution were written to reflect a compromise between preserving the rights of individual citizens and supporting a strong and secure Federal Government. Since its ratification on December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights has enshrined many of our most fundamental liberties and unalienable rights—including the freedoms of speech, worship, and assembly; the rights to trial by jury and due process, and the protections from unreasonable search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. For 225 years, the Bill of Rights has shaped our Nation and protected our citizens, and today, in honor of all those who have worked to secure these freedoms, we strive to continue forming a more perfect Union guided by an enduring belief in these highest ideals.</FP>
  <FP>As it was originally created, the Bill of Rights safeguarded personal liberties and ensured equal justice under the law for many—but not for all. In the centuries that followed its ratification, courageous Americans agitated and sacrificed to extend these rights to more people, moving us closer to ensuring opportunity and equality are not limited by one's race, sex, or circumstances. The desire and capacity to forge our own destinies have propelled us forward at every turn in history. The same principles that drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny, a country to cast off the stains of slavery, women to reach for the ballot, and workers to organize for their rights still remind us that our freedom is intertwined with the freedom of others. If we are to ensure the sacred ideals embodied in the Bill of Rights are afforded to everyone, each generation must do what those who came before them have done and recommit to holding fast to our values and protecting these freedoms.</FP>
  <FP>Two and a quarter centuries later, these 10 Constitutional Amendments remain a symbol of one of our Nation's first successful steps in our journey to uphold the rights of all citizens. On Bill of Rights Day, we celebrate the long arc of progress that transformed our Nation from a fledgling and fragile democracy to one in which civil rights are the birthright of all Americans. This progress was never inevitable, and as long as people remain willing to fight for justice, we can work to swing open more doors of opportunity and carry forward a vision of liberty and equality for generations to come.</FP>

  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2016, as <PRTPAGE P="351"/>Bill of Rights Day.

  <FP>1. Section 915(b) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (the “TFTEA”) (19 U.S.C. 4454) confers authority upon the President to provide preferential treatment for eligible articles imported directly from Nepal into the customs territory of the United States if the President determines that Nepal meets the eligibility requirements specified in section 915(b)(1)(A) of the TFTEA, taking into account the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B) of the TFTEA.</FP>
  <FP>2. Pursuant to section 915(b) of the TFTEA, I have determined that Nepal meets the eligibility requirements of section 915(b)(1)(A), taking into account the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B).</FP>
  <FP>3. Section 915(c) of the TFTEA describes the requirements for articles from Nepal to be considered eligible for duty-free treatment. Pursuant to section 915(c)(2)(A)(iv) of the TFTEA, the President may designate certain articles as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (Commission) in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from Nepal.</FP>
  <FP>4. Pursuant to sections 915(c)(2)(A)(iv) of the TFTEA, and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade Act, I have determined to designate the articles included in Annex I of this proclamation as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal.</FP>
  <FP>5. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (the “HTS”) (19 U.S.C. 1202) the substance of the relevant provisions of the Trade Act and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

  <FP>6. In order to implement the duty-free treatment provided in accordance with the provisions of the TFTEA, it is necessary to modify the HTS, thus incorporating the substance of relevant provisions of the TFTEA, and of actions taken thereunder, into the HTS, pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act.<PRTPAGE P="352"/>

Thus, pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)), President Bush terminated the designation of the Central African Republic as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act.</FP>
  <FP>8. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a “beneficiary sub-Saharan African country” if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).</FP>
  <FP>9. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act, based on actions that the Central African Republic has taken, I have determined that the Central African Republic meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA and the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act, and I have decided to designate the Central African Republic as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</FP>
  <FP>10. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the “USIFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).</FP>
  <FP>11. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.</FP>
  <FP>12. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the “2004 US-Israel Agreement”).</FP>
  <FP>13. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 US-Israel Agreement, President Bush determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.</FP>

  <FP>14. Each year from 2008 through 2015, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 US-Israel Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 US-Israel Agreement.<PRTPAGE P="353"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>15. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010; Proclamation 8770 of December 29, 2011; Proclamation 8921 of December 20, 2012; Proclamation 9072 of December 23, 2013; Proclamation 9223 of December 23, 2014; and Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015, modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period.</FP>
  <FP>16. On December 5, 2016, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 US-Israel Agreement is in force through December 31, 2017, and to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 US-Israel Agreement.</FP>
  <FP>17. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2017, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.</FP>
  <FP>18. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the “1988 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005) if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Convention) and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. In 2006 and 2011, the Commission recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to amendments made to the Convention. In Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, and Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, President Bush and I, respectively, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amendments to the Convention.</FP>
  <FP>19. Proclamation 8332 of December 29, 2008, implemented the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (the “USOFTA”) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USOFTA Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that President Bush determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9, and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to Oman set forth in Annex 2-B of the USOFTA.</FP>
  <FP>20. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods from Oman in categories that were modified to conform to the Convention, President Bush and I proclaimed in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771, respectively, modifications to the HTS that we determined were necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332.</FP>

  <FP>21. The United States and Oman are parties to the Convention. Because the substance of changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of the United States and Oman, the rules of origin set out in Annex 3-A and Annex 4-A of the USOFTA must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded <PRTPAGE P="354"/>under the USOFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771. The United States and Oman have agreed to make these changes.</FP>
  <FP>22. Section 202 of the USOFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note) provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing preferential tariff treatment under the USOFTA. Section 202(j) of the USOFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USOFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the USOFTA, subject to the exceptions stated in section 202(j)(2)(A) of the USOFTA Act.</FP>
  <FP>23. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the USOFTA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332.</FP>

  <FP>24. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), as amended, provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>25. Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, implemented the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the “USPTPA”) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the “USPTPA Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.26, 3.27, 3.28, and 3.29, and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to Panama set forth in Annex 3.3 of the USPTPA.</FP>
  <FP>26. The United States and Panama are parties to the Convention. Because changes to the Convention are reflected in slight differences of form between the national tariff schedules of the United States and Panama, the rules of origin set out in Annex 4.1 of the USPTPA must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USPTPA Act to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were proclaimed in Proclamation 8894. The United States and Panama have agreed to make these changes.</FP>
  <FP>27. Section 202 of the USPTPA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note) provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USPTPA. Section 202(o) of the USPTPA Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USPTPA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the USPTPA, subject to the exceptions stated in section 202(o) of the USPTPA Act.</FP>

  <FP>28. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the USPTPA Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain <PRTPAGE P="355"/>other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8894.</FP>

  <FP>29. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>30. Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the “CAFTA-DR”) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “CAFTA-DR Act”) (19 U.S.C. 4031), the staged reductions in duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28 of the CAFTA-DR.</FP>
  <FP>31. The United States, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the “CAFTA-DR countries”) are parties to the Convention. Because changes to the Convention are reflected in slight differences of form between the national tariff schedules of the United States and the other CAFTA-DR countries, Annexes 4.1, 3.25, and 3.29 of the CAFTA-DR must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the CAFTA-DR to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were proclaimed in Proclamation 7987. The United States and the other CAFTA-DR countries have agreed to make these changes.</FP>
  <FP>32. Section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28 of the CAFTA-DR.</FP>
  <FP>33. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and Proclamation 8771 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7987.</FP>

  <FP>34. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect before the thirtieth day <PRTPAGE P="356"/>after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 915 of the TFTEA (19 U.S.C. 4454), section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)); section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 2112 note); section 301 of title 3, United States Code; section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)); section 202 of the USOFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note); section 202 of the USPTPA Act (19 U.S.C. 3805 note); section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4031); and section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that:</FP>

  <PROC>Proclamation 9557 of December 16, 2016</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9557</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Wright Brothers Day, 2016By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>On December 17, 1903, two brothers from Dayton, Ohio successfully flew the world's first powered aircraft. The plane remained airborne for only 12 seconds, but Orville and Wilbur Wright's innovative legacy has endured for generations—unleashing unparalleled possibilities and forever transforming our way of life. On Wright Brothers Day, we celebrate the determination and ingenuity that drove their pursuit and recommit to shaping the future through our ideas and discoveries.</FP>
  <FP>As self-taught mechanics, the Wright brothers devoted years to research and experimentation before taking their talents and creativity to the strong winds above Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where they completed the monumental first flight. Their mother, Susan, spent considerable time in her youth designing and building mechanical appliances; she guided her children whenever she could and always encouraged them to chase their curiosities. As Orville and Wilbur grew, they followed their entrepreneurial instincts, launching a newspaper and later opening a bicycle shop to sell their designs. Their resilience through early failed attempts at flight, and their resolve to dream big in the face of that which had never been done before, still serves as an inspiration.</FP>

  <FP>Our capacity to harness new inventions and technologies to tackle our greatest challenges has allowed our Nation to lead the world in innovation. <PRTPAGE P="402"/>From sending people into the skies and outer space to finding ways to instantly communicate with others across the globe, the creativity inherent in our DNA and our commitment to science have sparked our progress and set us apart. The same American spirit of innovation that led the Wright brothers to test their theories again and again—finding ways to make things work and then make them even better—is still reflected in the imagination and tenacity that move inventors and explorers to push the frontiers of what is known and achieve groundbreaking feats that were once unimaginable.</FP>
  <FP>In upholding this legacy, we must resolve to help all young Americans understand that they can have a place in advancing science and technology—regardless of their race, gender, or circumstances. Brilliant ideas can come from anyone and anywhere, and it is our obligation to increase the availability of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) training and encourage the next generation to pursue STEM careers. This commitment to science and innovation can revitalize our communities and economies and reignite our shared sense of optimism and opportunity.</FP>
  <FP>Today, we reflect on the century of flight the Wright brothers helped make possible. Their story reminds us not just of where we have been, but where we still can go when we foster ingenuity and discovery and refuse to accept the sky as the limit. With the right investments and the perseverance of dreamers and doers who see a challenge and yearn to find a solution, there is nothing we cannot achieve.</FP>
  <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as “Wright Brothers Day” and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2016, as Wright Brothers Day.</FP>
  <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.BARACK  OBAMA</FP>
  <PROC>Proclamation 9558 of December 28, 2016</PROC>
  <EAR>Proc. 9558</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Bears Ears National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>

  <FP>Rising from the center of the southeastern Utah landscape and visible from every direction are twin buttes so distinctive that in each of the native languages of the region their name is the same: Hoon'Naqvut, Shash Jáa, Kwiyagatu Nukavachi, Ansh An Lashokdiwe, or “Bears Ears.” For hundreds of generations, native peoples lived in the surrounding deep sandstone canyons, desert mesas, and meadow mountaintops, which constitute one of the densest and most significant cultural landscapes in the United <PRTPAGE P="403"/>States. Abundant rock art, ancient cliff dwellings, ceremonial sites, and countless other artifacts provide an extraordinary archaeological and cultural record that is important to us all, but most notably the land is profoundly sacred to many Native American tribes, including the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah Ouray, Hopi Nation, and Zuni Tribe.</FP>
  <FP>The area's human history is as vibrant and diverse as the ruggedly beautiful landscape. From the earliest occupation, native peoples left traces of their presence. Clovis people hunted among the cliffs and canyons of Cedar Mesa as early as 13,000 years ago, leaving behind tools and projectile points in places like the Lime Ridge Clovis Site, one of the oldest known archaeological sites in Utah. Archaeologists believe that these early people hunted mammoths, ground sloths, and other now-extinct megafauna, a narrative echoed by native creation stories. Hunters and gatherers continued to live in this region in the Archaic Period, with sites dating as far back as 8,500 years ago.</FP>
  <FP>Ancestral Puebloans followed, beginning to occupy the area at least 2,500 years ago, leaving behind items from their daily life such as baskets, pottery, and weapons. These early farmers of Basketmaker II and III and builders of Pueblo I, II, and III left their marks on the land. The remains of single family dwellings, granaries, kivas, towers, and large villages and roads linking them together reveal a complex cultural history. “Moki steps,” hand and toe holds carved into steep canyon walls by the Ancestral Puebloans, illustrate the early people's ingenuity and perseverance and are still used today to access dwellings along cliff walls. Other, distinct cultures have thrived here as well—the Fremont People, Numic- and Athabaskan-speaking hunter-gatherers, and Utes and Navajos. Resources such as the Doll House Ruin in Dark Canyon Wilderness Area and the Moon House Ruin on Cedar Mesa allow visitors to marvel at artistry and architecture that have withstood thousands of seasons in this harsh climate.</FP>
  <FP>The landscape is a milieu of the accessible and observable together with the inaccessible and hidden. The area's petroglyphs and pictographs capture the imagination with images dating back at least 5,000 years and spanning a range of styles and traditions. From life-size ghostlike figures that defy categorization, to the more literal depictions of bighorn sheep, birds, and lizards, these drawings enable us to feel the humanity of these ancient artists. The Indian Creek area contains spectacular rock art, including hundreds of petroglyphs at Newspaper Rock. Visitors to Bears Ears can also discover more recent rock art left by the Ute, Navajo, and Paiute peoples. It is also the less visible sites, however—those that supported the food gathering, subsistence and ceremony of daily life—that tell the story of the people who lived here. Historic remnants of Native American sheep-herding and farming are scattered throughout the area, and pottery and Navajo hogans record the lifeways of native peoples in the 19th and 20th centuries.</FP>

  <FP>For thousands of years, humans have occupied and stewarded this land. With respect to most of these people, their contribution to the historical record is unknown, but some have played a more public role. Famed Navajo headman K'aayélii was born around 1800 near the twin Bears Ears buttes. His band used the area's remote canyons to elude capture by the <PRTPAGE P="404"/>U.S. Army and avoid the fate that befell many other Navajo bands: surrender, the Long Walk, and forced relocation to Bosque Redondo. Another renowned 19th century Navajo leader, “Hastiin Ch'ihaajin” Manuelito, was also born near the Bears Ears.</FP>
  <FP>The area's cultural importance to Native American tribes continues to this day. As they have for generations, these tribes and their members come here for ceremonies and to visit sacred sites. Throughout the region, many landscape features, such as Comb Ridge, the San Juan River, and Cedar Mesa, are closely tied to native stories of creation, danger, protection, and healing. The towering spires in the Valley of the Gods are sacred to the Navajo, representing ancient Navajo warriors frozen in stone. Traditions of hunting, fishing, gathering, and wood cutting are still practiced by tribal members, as is collection of medicinal and ceremonial plants, edible herbs, and materials for crafting items like baskets and footwear. The traditional ecological knowledge amassed by the Native Americans whose ancestors inhabited this region, passed down from generation to generation, offers critical insight into the historic and scientific significance of the area. Such knowledge is, itself, a resource to be protected and used in understanding and managing this landscape sustainably for generations to come.</FP>
  <FP>Euro-Americans first explored the Bears Ears area during the 18th century, and Mormon settlers followed in the late 19th century. The San Juan Mission expedition traversed this rugged country in 1880 on their journey to establish a new settlement in what is now Bluff, Utah. To ease the passage of wagons over the slick rock slopes and through the canyonlands, the settlers smoothed sections of the rock surface and constructed dugways and other features still visible along their route, known as the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail. Cabins, corrals, trails, and carved inscriptions in the rock reveal the lives of ranchers, prospectors, and early archaeologists. Cattle rustlers and other outlaws created a convoluted trail network known as the Outlaw Trail, said to be used by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. These outlaws took advantage of the area's network of canyons, including the aptly-named Hideout Canyon, to avoid detection.</FP>
  <FP>The area's stunning geology, from sharp pinnacles to broad mesas, labyrinthine canyons to solitary hoodoos, and verdant hanging gardens to bare stone arches and natural bridges, provides vital insights to geologists. In the east, the Abajo Mountains tower, reaching elevations of more than 11,000 feet. A long geologic history is documented in the colorful rock layers visible in the area's canyons.</FP>
  <FP>For long periods over 300 million years ago, these lands were inundated by tropical seas and hosted thriving coral reefs. These seas infused the area's black rock shale with salts as they receded. Later, the lands were bucked upwards multiple times by the Monument Upwarp, and near-volcanoes punched up through the rock, leaving their marks on the landscape without reaching the surface. In the sandstone of Cedar Mesa, fossil evidence has revealed large, mammal-like reptiles that burrowed into the sand to survive the blistering heat of the end of the Permian Period, when the region was dominated by a seaside desert. Later, in the Late Triassic Period more than 200 million years ago, seasonal monsoons flooded an ancient river system that fed a vast desert here.</FP>

  <FP>The paleontological resources in the Bears Ears area are among the richest and most significant in the United States, and protection of this area will <PRTPAGE P="405"/>provide important opportunities for further archaeological and paleontological study. Many sites, such as Arch Canyon, are teeming with fossils, and research conducted in the Bears Ears area is revealing new insights into the transition of vertebrate life from reptiles to mammals and from sea to land. Numerous ray-finned fish fossils from the Permian Period have been discovered, along with other late Paleozoic Era fossils, including giant amphibians, synapsid reptiles, and important plant fossils. Fossilized traces of marine and aquatic creatures such as clams, crayfish, fish, and aquatic reptiles have been found in Indian Creek's Chinle Formation, dating to the Triassic Period, and phytosaur and dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found along Comb Ridge. Paleontologists have identified new species of plant-eating crocodile-like reptiles and mass graves of lumbering sauropods, along with metoposaurus, crocodiles, and other dinosaur fossils. Fossilized trackways of early tetrapods can be seen in the Valley of the Gods and in Indian Creek, where paleontologists have also discovered exceptional examples of fossilized ferns, horsetails, and cycads. The Chinle Formation and the Wingate, Kayenta, and Navajo Formations above it provide one of the best continuous rock records of the Triassic-Jurassic transition in the world, crucial to understanding how dinosaurs dominated terrestrial ecosystems and how our mammalian ancestors evolved. In Pleistocene Epoch sediments, scientists have found traces of mammoths, short-faced bears, ground sloths, primates, and camels.</FP>
  <FP>From earth to sky, the region is unsurpassed in wonders. The star-filled nights and natural quiet of the Bears Ears area transport visitors to an earlier eon. Against an absolutely black night sky, our galaxy and others more distant leap into view. As one of the most intact and least roaded areas in the contiguous United States, Bears Ears has that rare and arresting quality of deafening silence.</FP>
  <FP>Communities have depended on the resources of the region for hundreds of generations. Understanding the important role of the green highlands in providing habitat for subsistence plants and animals, as well as capturing and filtering water from passing storms, the Navajo refer to such places as “Nahodishgish,” or places to be left alone. Local communities seeking to protect the mountains for their watershed values have long recognized the importance of the Bears Ears' headwaters. Wildfires, both natural and human-set, have shaped and maintained forests and grasslands of this area for millennia. Ranchers have relied on the forests and grasslands of the region for ages, and hunters come from across the globe for a chance at a bull elk or other big game. Today, ecological restoration through the careful use of wildfire and management of grazing and timber is working to restore and maintain the health of these vital watersheds and grasslands.</FP>

  <FP>The diversity of the soils and microenvironments in the Bears Ears area provide habitat for a wide variety of vegetation. The highest elevations, in the Elk Ridge area of the Manti-La Sal National Forest, contain pockets of ancient Engelmann spruce, ponderosa pine, aspen, and subalpine fir. Mesa tops include pinyon-juniper woodlands along with big sagebrush, low sage, blackbrush, rabbitbrush, bitterbrush, four-wing saltbush, shadscale, winterfat, Utah serviceberry, western chokecherry, hackberry, barberry, cliff rose, and greasewood. Canyons contain diverse vegetation ranging from yucca and cacti such as prickly pear, claret cup, and Whipple's fishhook to mountain mahogany, ponderosa pine, alder, sagebrush, birch, dogwood, <PRTPAGE P="406"/>and Gambel's oak, along with occasional stands of aspen. Grasses and herbaceous species such as bluegrass, bluestem, giant ryegrass, ricegrass, needle and thread, yarrow, common mallow, balsamroot, low larkspur, horsetail, and peppergrass also grow here, as well as pinnate spring parsley, Navajo penstemon, Canyonlands lomatium, and the Abajo daisy.</FP>
  <FP>Tucked into winding canyons are vibrant riparian communities characterized by Fremont cottonwood, western sandbar willow, yellow willow, and box elder. Numerous seeps provide year-round water and support delicate hanging gardens, moisture-loving plants, and relict species such as Douglas fir. A few populations of the rare Kachina daisy, endemic to the Colorado Plateau, hide in shaded seeps and alcoves of the area's canyons. A genetically distinct population of Kachina daisy was also found on Elk Ridge. The alcove columbine and cave primrose, also regionally endemic, grow in seeps and hanging gardens in the Bears Ears landscape. Wildflowers such as beardtongue, evening primrose, aster, Indian paintbrush, yellow and purple beeflower, straight bladderpod, Durango tumble mustard, scarlet gilia, globe mallow, sand verbena, sego lily, cliffrose, sacred datura, monkey flower, sunflower, prince's plume, hedgehog cactus, and columbine, bring bursts of color to the landscape.</FP>
  <FP>The diverse vegetation and topography of the Bears Ears area, in turn, support a variety of wildlife species. Mule deer and elk range on the mesas and near canyon heads, which provide crucial habitat for both species. The Cedar Mesa landscape is home to bighorn sheep which were once abundant but still live in Indian Creek, and in the canyons north of the San Juan River. Small mammals such as desert cottontail, black-tailed jackrabbit, prairie dog, Botta's pocket gopher, white-tailed antelope squirrel, Colorado chipmunk, canyon mouse, deer mouse, pinyon mouse, and desert woodrat, as well as Utah's only population of Abert's tassel-eared squirrels, find shelter and sustenance in the landscape's canyons and uplands. Rare shrews, including a variant of Merriam's shrew and the dwarf shrew can be found in this area.</FP>
  <FP>Carnivores, including badger, coyote, striped skunk, ringtail, gray fox, bobcat, and the occasional mountain lion, all hunt here, while porcupines use their sharp quills and climbing abilities to escape these predators. Oral histories from the Ute describe the historic presence of bison, antelope, and abundant bighorn sheep, which are also depicted in ancient rock art. Black bear pass through the area but are rarely seen, though they are common in the oral histories and legends of this region, including those of the Navajo.</FP>
  <FP>Consistent sources of water in a dry landscape draw diverse wildlife species to the area's riparian habitats, including an array of amphibian species such as tiger salamander, red-spotted toad, Woodhouse's toad, canyon tree frog, Great Basin spadefoot, and northern leopard frog. Even the most sharp-eyed visitors probably will not catch a glimpse of the secretive Utah night lizard. Other reptiles in the area include the sagebrush lizard, eastern fence lizard, tree lizard, side-blotched lizard, plateau striped whiptail, western rattlesnake, night snake, striped whipsnake, and gopher snake.</FP>

  <FP>Raptors such as the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, northern harrier, northern goshawk, red-tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, American kestrel, flammulated owl, and great horned owl hunt their prey on the mesa tops with deadly speed and accuracy. The largest contiguous critical <PRTPAGE P="407"/>habitat for the threatened Mexican spotted owl is on the Manti-La Sal National Forest. Other bird species found in the area include Merriam's turkey, Williamson's sapsucker, common nighthawk, white-throated swift, ash-throated flycatcher, violet-green swallow, cliff swallow, mourning dove, pinyon jay, sagebrush sparrow, canyon towhee, rock wren, sage thrasher, and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher.</FP>

  <FP>As the skies darken in the evenings, visitors may catch a glimpse of some the area's at least 15 species of bats, including the big free-tailed bat, pallid bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, spotted bat, and silver-haired bat. Tinajas, rock depressions filled with rainwater, provide habitat for many specialized aquatic species, including pothole beetles and freshwater shrimp. <E T="03">Eucosma navajoensis</E>, an endemic moth that has only been described near Valley of the Gods, is unique to this area.</FP>
  <FP>Protection of the Bears Ears area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. The Bears Ears area has been proposed for protection by members of Congress, Secretaries of the Interior, State and tribal leaders, and local conservationists for at least 80 years. The area contains numerous objects of historic and of scientific interest, and it provides world class outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock climbing, hunting, hiking, backpacking, canyoneering, whitewater rafting, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Because visitors travel from near and far, these lands support a growing travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic opportunity for the region.</FP>
  <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>

  <EAR>Proc. 9559</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Gold Butte National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>In southeast Nevada lies a landscape of contrast and transition, where dramatically chiseled red sandstone, twisting canyons, and tree-clad mountains punctuate flat stretches of the Mojave Desert. This remote and rugged desert landscape is known as Gold Butte.</FP>
  <FP>The Gold Butte area contains an extraordinary variety of diverse and irreplaceable scientific, historic, and prehistoric resources, including vital plant and wildlife habitat, significant geological formations, rare fossils, important sites from the history of Native Americans, and remnants of our Western mining and ranching heritage. The landscape reveals a story of thousands of years of human interaction with this harsh environment and provides a rare glimpse into the lives of Nevada's first inhabitants, the rich and varied indigenous cultures that followed, and the eventual arrival of Euro-American settlers. Canyons and intricate rock formations are a stunning backdrop to the area's famously beautiful rock art, and the desert provides critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise.</FP>
  <FP>Gold Butte's dynamic environment has provided food and shelter to humans for at least 12,000 years. Remnants of massive agave roasting pits, charred remains of goosefoot and pinyon pine nuts, bone fragments, and projectile points used to hunt big horn sheep and smaller game serve as evidence of the remarkable abilities of indigenous communities to eke out sustenance from this unforgiving landscape. Visitors to Gold Butte can still see ancient rock shelters and hearth remnants concealed in the area's dramatic Aztec Sandstone formations. This brightly hued sandstone is the canvas for the area's spectacular array of rock art, depicting human figures, animals, and swirling abstract designs at locations like the famed Falling Man petroglyph site and Kohta Circus. Pottery sherds and other archaeological artifacts scattered throughout the landscape reveal the area's role as a corridor for the interregional trade of pottery, salt, and rare minerals. These world-renowned archaeological sites and objects are helping scientists to better understand interactions between ancient cultural groups.</FP>
  <FP>By the time Spanish explorers arrived in the region in the late eighteenth century, the Gold Butte area was home to the Southern Paiute people, who to this day, retain a spiritual and cultural connection with the land and use it for traditional purposes such as ceremonies and plant harvesting. Hunters and settlers of European descent followed the explorers, and, by 1865, Mormon pioneers had built settlements in the region.</FP>

  <FP>These newcomers grazed livestock and explored Gold Butte's unique geology in pursuit of mining riches. Their activities left behind historic sites and objects that tell the story of the American West, including the Gold Butte townsite, a mining boomtown established in the early 1900s, but mostly abandoned by 1910. Several building foundations and arrastas—large flat rocks used for crushing ore—remain at the townsite today. Settlers built corrals out of wood or stone, some of which are still standing in the Gold Butte area, including one near the Gold Butte townsite and one <PRTPAGE P="413"/>at Horse Springs, along the Gold Butte Scenic Byway. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was put to work in the area, leaving behind a variety of historic features including a dam and remnants of a camp in the Whitney Pockets area, in the northeastern region of Gold Butte.</FP>
  <FP>The Gold Butte landscape that visitors experience today is the product of millions of years of heat and pressure as well as the eroding forces of water and wind that molded this vast and surreal desert terrain. Rising up from the Virgin River to an elevation of almost 8,000 feet, the Virgin Mountains delineate the area's northeast corner and provide a stunning backdrop for the rugged gray and red desert of the lower elevations. Faulted carbonate and silicate rock form the ridges and peaks of this range, which are regularly snow-covered in winter and spring, while the southern region of Gold Butte is laced with a series of wide granitic ridges and narrow canyons. These broad landscape features are dotted with fantastical geologic formations, including vividly hued Aztec Sandstone twisted into otherworldly shapes by wind and water, as well as pale, desolate granitic domes. An actively-expanding 1,200 square-meter sinkhole known as the Devil's Throat has been the subject of multiple scientific studies that have enhanced our understanding of sinkhole formation.</FP>
  <FP>The Gold Butte landscape is a mosaic of braided and shallow washes that flow into the Virgin River to the north and directly into Lake Mead on the south and west. Several natural springs provide important water sources for the plants and animals living here. The arid eastern Mojave Desert landscape that dominates the area is characterized by the creosote bush and white bursage vegetative community that covers large, open expanses scattered with low shrubs. Blackbrush scrub, a slow-growing species that can live up to 400 years, is abundant in middle elevations. Both creosote-bursage and blackbrush scrub vegetation communities can take decades or even centuries to recover from disturbances due to the long-lived nature of the plant species in these vegetative communities and the area's low rainfall. These vegetation communities are impacted by human uses, invasive species, wildfires, and changing climates. Gypsum deposits are a distinctive aspect of the Mojave Desert ecosystem and result in soil that contains physical and chemical properties that stress many plants, but also support endemic and rare species. For example, the sticky ringstem, Las Vegas buckwheat, and Las Vegas bearpoppy are unique plants that rely on gypsum soil; the populations in Gold Butte are some of only a handful of isolated populations of these species left in the world. Other rare plants in Gold Butte include the threecorner milkvetch and sticky wild buckwheat, which are sand-dependent species, as well as the Rosy two-tone beardtongue and the Mokiak milkvetch. Scattered stands of Joshua trees, an emblem of the Mojave Desert, dot the landscape along with Mojave yucca, cacti species, and chaparral species, among others.</FP>

  <FP>The often snowcapped peaks of the Virgin Mountains in the northeastern corner of Gold Butte stand in stark contrast to the desolate desert landscapes found elsewhere in the area. Due to their elevation of almost 8,000 feet, these mountains exhibit a transition between ecosystems in the southwest. At the highest points of the Virgin Mountains, visitors can hike through Ponderosa pine and white fir forests, and visit the southernmost stand of Douglas fir in Nevada. In this area, visitors are also treated to a rare sight: the Silver State's only stand of the Arizona cypress. The lower to middle elevations of the area are home to stands of pinyon pine, Utah <PRTPAGE P="414"/>juniper, sagebrush, and acacia woodlands, along with occasional mesquite stands. By adding structural complexity to a shrub-dominated landscape, these woodlands provide important breeding, foraging, and resting places for a variety of creatures, including birds and insects, and support a number of plant species.</FP>
  <FP>Gold Butte also provides habitat for a number of wildlife species. It has been designated as critical habitat for the Mojave desert tortoise, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. These slow-footed symbols of the American Southwest rely on the creosote-bursage ecosystem that is widespread here. A generally reclusive reptile, the Mojave desert tortoise uses the protective cover of underground burrows to escape extreme desert conditions and as shelter from predators.</FP>
  <FP>Other amphibians and reptiles also make their homes in Gold Butte. For example, once considered extinct and now a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act, the relict leopard frog has been released into spring sites in the area in a collaborative effort by local, State, and Federal entities to help revive this still very small population. The banded Gila monster, the only venomous lizard in the United States, has also been recorded in Gold Butte. Many other reptile species—including the banded gecko,  California kingsnake, desert iguana, desert night lizard, glossy snake, Great Basin collared lizard, Mojave green rattlesnake, sidewinder, Sonoran lyre snake, southern desert horned lizard, speckled rattlesnake, western leaf-nosed snake, western long-nosed snake, and western red-tailed skink—also have populations or potential habitats in the area.</FP>
  <FP>The Gold Butte area serves as an effective corridor between Lake Mead and the Virgin Mountains for large mammals, including desert bighorn sheep and mountain lions. Smaller mammals in Gold Butte include white-tailed antelope squirrel, desert kangaroo rat, and the desert pocket mouse. Several species of bat, including the Pallid bat, Allen's big-eared bat, western pipistrelle bat, and the Brazilian free-tailed bat, are also found here, as well as the northern Mojave blue butterfly.</FP>
  <FP>Bald and golden eagles, red-tailed and Cooper's hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts soar above Gold Butte. Closer to the ground, one can spot a variety of birds, including the western burrowing owl, common poorwill, Costa's hummingbird, pinyon jay, Bendire's thrasher, Virginia's warbler, Lucy's warbler, black-chinned sparrow, and gray vireo. Migratory birds, including the Calliope hummingbird, gray flycatcher, sage sparrow, lesser nighthawk, ash-throated flycatcher, and the Brewer's sparrow, also make stop-overs in the area. These birds, and a variety of other avian species, use the diversity of habitats in the area to meet many of their seasonal, migratory, or year-round life cycle needs.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to providing homes to modern species of plants and wildlife, the area shows great potential for continued paleontological research, with resources such as recently discovered dinosaur tracks dating back to the Jurassic Period. These fossil trackways were found in Gold Butte's distinctive Aztec Sandstone and also include prints from squirrel-sized reptilian ancestors of mammals.</FP>

  <FP>The protection of the Gold Butte area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the historic and scientific values of this area, and <PRTPAGE P="415"/>its many objects of historic and of scientific interest, remain for the benefit of all Americans.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Mentoring Month, 2017By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>With every generation, our Nation has expanded the essential idea that no matter who you are or where you come from, America is a place where—with hard work and perseverance—you can make it if you try. Although obstacles and challenges along the way can be discouraging, the mentorship and support of others have always motivated our people to persevere—even in the toughest of times. At the start of each new year, we observe National Mentoring Month to honor the parents, families, teachers, coaches, and mentors who pour their time and their love into lifting up America's daughters and sons.</FP>
  <FP>Nobody succeeds on their own: each young person's strength and resilience is fostered by those who have taught them they can do anything they put their mind to. Whether helping mentees study for a test, learn a new skill, or lift their heads up after a setback, mentors provide them the chance they need to move forward and set their sights even higher. And in helping mentees achieve their goals, mentors can inspire them to reach back and provide the same support to someone else in need of a mentor. To learn how you can mentor others and make a lasting difference, visit www.Serve.gov/Mentor.</FP>
  <FP>In too many communities, many children still have the odds stacked against them, which is why my Administration has striven to increase mentorship opportunities across our country. Among other steps we have taken, we established the My Brother's Keeper initiative, which has inspired private organizations and communities in every State to address opportunity gaps and encourage mentorship as a tool for helping all young people reach their full potential. At the White House, we started our own mentee program and regularly met with local youth to provide leadership and guidance. And our efforts to bring higher education within reach for more Americans and expand apprenticeship initiatives have helped ensure more students can access the educational and career opportunities they need to thrive.</FP>
  <FP>This month, we reflect on the transformative role mentorship can play and acknowledge the many ways that mentors have helped our next generation of leaders and innovators grow. As a Nation, we are stronger when every individual has the opportunity to contribute to our American story. By working to give each person a better chance at success, we can unlock their potential and empower them to serve others in the same way.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2017By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Our Nation wrestled with the issue of slavery in a way that nearly tore us apart—its fundamental notion in direct contradiction with our founding premise that we are all created equal. The courageous individuals who rejected such cruelty helped us overcome one of the most painful chapters in our history as we worked to realize the promise of equality and justice for all. But today, in too many places around the world—including right here in the United States—the injustice of modern slavery and human trafficking still tears at our social fabric. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we resolve to shine a light on every dark corner where human trafficking still threatens the basic rights and freedoms of others.</FP>
  <FP>From factories and brothels to farms and mines, millions of men, women, and children in the United States and around the world are exploited for their bodies and their labor. Whether through violence, deceit, or the promises of a better life, some of the most vulnerable populations among us—including migrants and refugees fleeing conflict or disaster, homeless LGBT youth, Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls, and children in poverty—are preyed upon by human traffickers. In order to rid the world of modern slavery we must do everything in our power to combat these violations of human decency.</FP>
  <FP>The United States has pursued efforts to address these crimes and lift up individuals who have suffered unspeakable abuse at the hands of traffickers. Through the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, we have joined with the private sector, faith communities, law enforcement, and advocates to coordinate efforts to prevent trafficking and protect victims. Focusing on an agenda that prioritizes victim services, the rule of law, procurement of supplies, and increasing public awareness, the Task Force has strengthened Federal efforts to end human trafficking. In 2012, I issued an Executive Order to strengthen protections against human trafficking in Federal contracting, and nearly a year ago, I signed legislation that strengthened our ability to prevent products made with forced labor, including child labor, from entering American markets.</FP>

  <FP>We must address the consequences of human trafficking and work to tackle its root causes. This past fiscal year, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice provided more than $60 million to community-based organizations and task forces to assist human trafficking victims, and since the beginning of my Administration, we have nearly tripled the number of victims connected to services. The Department of <PRTPAGE P="421"/>Homeland Security has also taken steps to streamline immigration procedures for trafficking victims and ensure their regulations are consistent with existing law. And through new Victims of Crime Act regulations, Federal funds can now be used to help human trafficking victims with their housing. Through the White House Council on Women and Girls, we have worked to address the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately affects those especially vulnerable to sex trafficking—including young women and girls of color. And the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking—comprised of 11 human trafficking survivors of diverse backgrounds and experiences—recently released its first set of recommendations for combating human trafficking while keeping survivor perspectives in mind.</FP>
  <FP>Every action we take at home, from the clothing we wear to the food we eat, is connected to what happens around the world. As a Nation, we have worked to address the problem of forced labor in our supply chains, and as individuals, we must strive to be conscientious consumers. Working with our friends and allies, we have made this issue an international priority. Just this year we used multilateral fora, including the North American Leaders Summit, the East Asia Summit, and the United Nations, to raise awareness and work with partners around the globe. In addition to urging other countries to develop and expand their anti-trafficking laws and services for victims, we are also stepping up our foreign assistance in this area. Working alongside the international community, we have seen significant increases in trafficking prosecutions and convictions, and we have made great strides in supporting victims.</FP>
  <FP>As leaders in the global undertaking to end the exploitation of human beings for profit, we must always remember that our freedom is bound to the freedom of others. This month, let us find inspiration in America's progress toward justice, opportunity, and prosperity for all and reaffirm our pledge to continue fighting for human rights around the world.</FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call upon businesses, national and community organizations, families, and all Americans to recognize the vital role we must play in ending all forms of slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">National Stalking Awareness Month, 2017By the President of the United States of America</HD>
  <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
  <FP>Every year, stalkers deny too many people the comfort and safety they deserve, violating our basic expectation of dignity and respect for all. Posing risks to both the physical and emotional health of victims, stalking is recognized as a crime across our Nation. This month, we join together in support of victims to raise awareness of this threat and reaffirm the importance of ensuring every person can live free from fear of violence, harassment, and any form of stalking.</FP>
  <FP>Approximately 1 in 6 women and 1 in 19 men will be victims of stalking. Perpetrators of stalking seek power and control by following, harassing, or pursuing victims in unwanted or repeated ways. Stalking can occur digitally—through cell phones and on social media platforms—as well as in person through repeated threats or acts of physical violence. And whether committed by acquaintances, former partners, or strangers, stalking can cause anxiety, depression, and feelings of helplessness, as well as a wide variety of general health and sleeping problems. Stalking victims live with the fear of not knowing what will happen next, and many are often forced to change their daily activities, move to a different location, or take time off from school or work.</FP>
  <FP>Along with combating domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault, confronting stalking and supporting victims is an important part of my Administration's efforts to end violence against women. And to ensure that violence against women, including stalking, is never tolerated, Vice President Biden has also led efforts to help change this culture. In 2013, I signed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which identifies stalking as a key focus area in which we can improve support for victims. Because of an Executive Order I signed in 2015, victims employed by Federal contractors can now use paid sick leave for absences related to stalking, and in the past year, many Federal agencies have also increased their support for victims as part of ongoing work to address the effects of domestic violence in the workplace. The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently finalized a new rule that strengthens housing protections for stalking victims, helping to secure their basic right to a safe living environment. And through a new Government-wide training tool designed to educate Federal employees on how to recognize and respond to stalking—and how to support colleagues who may be victims—we have worked to enhance policies that support affected employees.</FP>

  <FP>Nobody should ever feel unsafe in their homes and communities, which is why we must work to lift up victims and survivors who know the distress and anxiety of being stalked. Throughout National Stalking Awareness Month, let us reaffirm the value of privacy and security for all as we continue striving to ensure offenders are held accountable. If we pursue such progress and change with the passion and empathy that victims of stalking deserve, we can build a future where all people are free to live out their dreams.<PRTPAGE P="423"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2017 as National Stalking Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to learn the signs of stalking, acknowledge stalking as a serious crime, and urge those affected not to be afraid to speak out or ask for help. Let us also resolve to support victims and survivors, and to create communities that are secure and supportive for all Americans.</FP>

  <EAR>EO 13717</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management Standard</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, as amended, and section 121(a) of title 40, United States Code, and to improve the Nation's resilience to earthquakes, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the security and resilience of the Nation against earthquakes, to promote public safety, economic strength, and national security. To that end, the Federal Government must continue to take proactive steps to enhance the resilience of buildings that are owned, leased, financed, or regulated by the Federal Government. When making investment decisions related to Federal buildings, each executive department and agency (agency) responsible for implementing this order shall seek to enhance resilience by reducing risk to the lives of building occupants and improving continued performance of essential functions following future earthquakes. The Federal Government recognizes that building codes and standards primarily focus on ensuring minimum acceptable levels of earthquake safety for preserving the lives of building occupants. To achieve true resilience against earthquakes, however, new and existing buildings may need to exceed those codes and standards to ensure, for example, that the buildings can continue to perform their essential functions following future earthquakes. Agencies are thus encouraged to consider going beyond the codes and standards set out in this order to ensure that buildings are fully earthquake resilient.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Requirements for Earthquake Safety of New Federal Buildings, Improvements to Existing Federal Buildings, and Federally Leased, Financed, or Regulated Buildings.</E>
  </FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">New Buildings and Alterations to Existing Buildings.</E> Each agency responsible for the design and construction of a new building or an alteration <PRTPAGE P="432"/>to an existing building shall ensure that the building is designed, constructed, or altered, respectively, in accord with appropriate earthquake-resistant design and construction codes and standards as set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of this order.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Space Leased for Federal Occupancy.</E> Each agency responsible for the lease of a building shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that it leases only buildings that have been designed and constructed in accord with the appropriate earthquake-resistant design and construction standards that apply to the type of lease at issue, as set forth in section 3(c) of this order.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal Assistance Programs.</E> Each agency assisting in the financing, through Federal grants or loans, or guaranteeing the financing, through loan or mortgage insurance programs, of a newly constructed building shall consider updating its procedures for providing the assistance to be consistent with section 3(a) of this order, to assure appropriate consideration of earthquake safety.</P>
  <P>(d) <E T="03">Federally Regulated Buildings.</E> Each agency with responsibility for regulating the structural safety of a new building shall consider using earthquake-resistant design and construction standards for the new building consistent with section 3(a) of this order.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Codes, Standards, and Concurrent Requirements</E>. (a) Commencing within 90 days after the date of this order, each agency shall ensure that every new building for which the agency has not started programming is in compliance with the earthquake-resistant design provisions of the 2015 editions of the International Building Code (IBC) or the International Residential Code (IRC), nationally recognized building codes promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or equivalent codes, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IRC or IBC, each agency that constructs buildings shall determine whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If an agency determines that a new version is a nationally recognized code, it shall ensure that any building, for which the agency has not started programming, shall be in compliance with that new version or an equivalent code.</FP>

  <P>(b) Each agency that owns an existing Federal building shall adopt the <E T="03">Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased Buildings</E> (Standards), which are developed, issued, and maintained by the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), as the minimum level acceptable for managing the earthquake risks in that building. Any agency that has not adopted the Standards at the time of this order shall adopt the Standards no later than 90 days from the date of this order. All agencies shall adopt subsequent editions of the Standards as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 2 years following their issuance.</P>

  <P>(c) Each agency that leases space in an existing building shall adopt the Standards as the minimum level acceptable for managing the earthquake risks in that building. This requirement shall apply to existing leases or leases existing at the time of issuance of updated Standards only to the extent appropriate, as determined by the leasing agency. With respect to <PRTPAGE P="433"/>leases for a building being constructed to accommodate a Federal agency under the authority in 40 U.S.C. 585(a), the leasing agency shall ensure that the building complies with the earthquake-resistant design and construction standards that would apply to a building constructed by the agency pursuant to section 3(a) of this order. With respect to such leases entered into under authority other than 40 U.S.C. 585(a), the leasing agency shall ensure that the building complies with the earthquake-resistant design and construction standards that would apply to a building constructed by the agency pursuant to section 3(a) of this order, to the extent permitted by law.</P>
  <P>(d) Agencies may require higher performance levels than exist in the codes and standards described in sections 3(a), (b), and (c) of this order.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Agency and Committee Responsibilities.</E> (a) The ICSSC shall be composed of representatives of all Federal agencies engaged in construction, financing of construction, or related activities. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Lead Agency, currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), shall lead the ICSSC, and shall lead the development and maintenance of ICSSC guidelines to assist the Federal agencies with implementing earthquake risk reduction measures in their construction programs.</FP>
  <P>(b) Agencies whose activities are covered by this order shall designate one or more Seismic Safety Coordinator(s) to serve as focal points for the agency's compliance with this order and to participate in the ICSSC as appropriate. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall identify its Seismic Safety Coordinator(s) to the Director of NIST.</P>
  <P>(c) The Director of NIST, on behalf of the ICSSC, shall issue implementing guidelines to assist agency compliance with this order within 8 months of the date of this order. The implementing guidelines shall provide specific guidance, including guidance about the roles and responsibilities of the agencies under section 2 of this order. The implementing guidelines shall also describe the responsibilities and necessary qualifications of the Seismic Safety Coordinator.</P>
  <P>(d) The Director of NIST, on behalf of the ICSSC, shall provide assistance in interpreting the implementing guidelines to the Federal departments and agencies.</P>
  <P>(e) The ICSSC shall publish updated Standards for assessing and enhancing the earthquake resilience of existing buildings as required by this order. The ICSSC shall review and update the Standards as needed to comply with this order at the maximum interval of every 6 years. Participation in the ICSSC shall continue to be open to all agencies with programs affected by this order. The Director of NIST shall provide support for the secretariat of the ICSSC and determine the frequency and scope of the ICSSC meetings as necessary to support this order.</P>
  <P>(f) Agencies whose activities are covered by this order shall submit biennial reports to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of NIST on their progress in implementing the order, commencing 2 years from the date of this order.</P>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13719 of February 9, 2016</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13719</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishment of the Federal Privacy Council</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> The mission of the United States Government is to serve its people. In order to accomplish its mission, the Government lawfully collects, maintains, and uses large amounts of information about people in a wide range of contexts. Protecting privacy in the collection and handling of this information is fundamental to the successful accomplishment of the Government's mission. The proper functioning of Government requires the public's trust, and to maintain that trust the Government must strive to uphold the highest standards for collecting, maintaining, and using personal data. Privacy has been at the heart of our democracy from its inception, and we need it now more than ever.</FP>
  <FP>Executive departments and agencies (agencies) already take seriously their mission to protect privacy and have been working diligently to advance that mission through existing interagency mechanisms. Today's challenges, however, require that we find even more effective and innovative ways to improve the Government's efforts. Our efforts to meet these new challenges and preserve our core value of privacy, while delivering better and more effective Government services for the American people, demand leadership and enhanced coordination and collaboration among a diverse group of stakeholders and experts.</FP>
  <FP>Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States Government that agencies shall establish an interagency support structure that: builds on existing interagency efforts to protect privacy and provides expertise and assistance to agencies; expands the skill and career development opportunities of agency privacy professionals; improves the management of agency privacy programs by identifying and sharing lessons learned and best practices; and promotes collaboration between and among agency privacy professionals to reduce unnecessary duplication of efforts and to ensure the effective, efficient, and consistent implementation of privacy policy Government-wide.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy on Senior Agency Officials for Privacy.</E> Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) shall issue a revised policy on the role and designation of the Senior Agency Officials for Privacy. The policy shall provide guidance on the Senior Agency Official for Privacy's responsibilities at their agencies, required level of expertise, adequate level of resources, and other matters as determined by the Director. Agencies shall implement the requirements of the policy within a reasonable time frame as prescribed by the Director and consistent with applicable law.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Responsibilities of Agency Heads.</E> The head of each agency, consistent with guidance to be issued by the Director as required in section 2 of this order, shall designate or re-designate a Senior Agency Official for Privacy with the experience and skills necessary to manage an agency-wide privacy program. In addition, the head of each agency, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with ongoing activities, shall work with the Federal Privacy Council, established in section 4 of this order.<PRTPAGE P="440"/>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Steps to Increase Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth of the American Economy</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to protect American consumers and workers and encourage competition in the U.S. economy, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> Maintaining, encouraging, and supporting a fair, efficient, and competitive marketplace is a cornerstone of the American economy. Consumers and workers need both competitive markets and information to make informed choices.</FP>
  <FP>Certain business practices such as unlawful collusion, illegal bid rigging, price fixing, and wage setting, as well as anticompetitive exclusionary conduct and mergers stifle competition and erode the foundation of America's economic vitality. The immediate results of such conduct—higher prices and poorer service for customers, less innovation, fewer new businesses being launched, and reduced opportunities for workers—can impact Americans in every walk of life.</FP>
  <FP>Competitive markets also help advance national priorities, such as the delivery of affordable health care, energy independence, and improved access to fast and affordable broadband. Competitive markets also promote economic growth, which creates opportunity for American workers and encourages entrepreneurs to start innovative companies that create jobs.</FP>
  <FP>The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have a proven record of detecting and stopping anticompetitive conduct and challenging mergers and acquisitions that threaten to consolidate markets and reduce competition.</FP>
  <FP>Promoting competitive markets and ensuring that consumers and workers have access to the information needed to make informed choices must be a shared priority across the Federal Government. Executive departments and agencies can contribute to these goals through, among other things, pro-competitive rulemaking and regulations, and by eliminating regulations that create barriers to or limit competition. Such Government-wide action is essential to ensuring that consumers, workers, startups, small businesses, and farms reap the full benefits of competitive markets.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Agency Responsibilities.</E> (a) Executive departments and agencies with authorities that could be used to enhance competition (agencies) shall, where consistent with other laws, use those authorities to promote competition, arm consumers and workers with the information they need to make informed choices, and eliminate regulations that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American public.</FP>

  <P>(b) Agencies shall identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to build upon efforts to detect abuses such as price fixing, anticompetitive behavior in labor and other input markets, exclusionary conduct, and blocking access to critical resources that are needed for competitive entry. Behaviors that appear to violate our antitrust laws <PRTPAGE P="453"/>should be referred to antitrust enforcers at DOJ and the FTC. Such a referral shall not preclude further action by the referring agency against that behavior under that agency's relevant statutory authority.</P>
  <P>(c) Agencies shall also identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to address undue burdens on competition. As permitted by law, agencies shall consult with other interested parties to identify ways that the agency can promote competition through pro-competitive rulemaking and regulations, by providing consumers and workers with information they need to make informed choices, and by eliminating regulations that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American public.</P>
  <P>(d) Not later than 30 days from the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the National Economic Council an initial list of (1) actions each agency can potentially take to promote more competitive markets; (2) any specific practices, such as blocking access to critical resources, that potentially restrict meaningful consumer or worker choice or unduly stifle new market entrants, along with any actions the agency can potentially take to address those practices; and (3) any relevant authorities and tools potentially available to enhance competition or make information more widely available for consumers and workers.</P>
  <P>(e) Not later than 60 days from the date of this order, agencies shall report to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, recommendations on agency-specific actions that eliminate barriers to competition, promote greater competition, and improve consumer access to information needed to make informed purchasing decisions. Such recommendations shall include a list of priority actions, including rulemakings, as well as timelines for completing those actions.</P>
  <P>(f) Subsequently, agencies shall report semi-annually to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, on additional actions that they plan to undertake to promote greater competition.</P>
  <P>(g) Sections 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f) of this order do not require reporting of information related to law enforcement policy and activities.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</FP>
  <P>(b) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.</P>
  <P>(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>

  <EAR>EO 13728</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to improve the Nation's resilience to wildfire, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the security and resilience of the Nation against the impacts of wildfire. The annual estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically over the past six decades as a result of multi-year drought conditions in combination with accumulated fuel loads, growing populations residing in the wildland-urban interface, and associated increases in the exposure of built environments. As such, we must continue to ensure our Nation is resilient to wildfire in order to promote public safety, economic strength, and national security.</FP>
  <FP>The Federal Government must continue to take proactive steps to enhance the resilience of buildings that are owned by the Federal Government and are located on Federal land. Each executive department and agency (agency) responsible for implementing this order shall seek to enhance the resilience of its buildings when making investment decisions to ensure continued performance of essential functions and to reduce risks to its buildings' occupants in the event of a wildfire.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Codes and Concurrent Requirements.</E> (a) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency shall ensure that every new Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with the 2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.<PRTPAGE P="461"/>
  </FP>
  <P>(b) Commencing within 90 days of the completion of the implementing guidelines as described in section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency responsible for the alteration of an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk for which the agency has not completed design shall ensure that the alteration is effectuated in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. When the ICC releases a new version of the IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally recognized code for the purposes of 40 U.S.C. 3312(b), as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. If a determination is made that a new version is a nationally recognized code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section for which the agency has not completed design is in compliance with that new version, or an equivalent code, consistent with the provisions of and to the extent required by 40 U.S.C. 3312.</P>
  <P>(c) Each agency that owns an existing Federal building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that such existing buildings are in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.</P>
  <P>(d) The heads of agencies whose activities are covered by sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order shall complete a wildfire risk assessment of their existing Federal buildings above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface and are strongly encouraged to consider creating and maintaining a defensible space in compliance with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code, for each of those buildings they determine to be at highest risk.</P>
  <P>(e) Each agency that leases space in a building to be constructed for the predominant use of an agency above 5,000 rentable square feet in the wildland-urban interface in an area of greater than moderate wildfire risk is strongly encouraged to ensure that the building is designed and constructed in accord with the IWUIC, or an equivalent code.</P>
  <P>(f) Each agency assisting in the financing, through Federal grants or loans, or guaranteeing the financing, through loan or mortgage insurance premiums, of a newly constructed building or of an alteration of an existing building above 5,000 gross square feet within the wildland-urban interface at moderate or greater wildfire risk shall consider updating its procedures for providing the assistance to be consistent with sections 2(a) and 2(b) of this order, to ensure appropriate consideration of wildfire-resistant design and construction.</P>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13729 of May 18, 2016</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13729</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">A Comprehensive Approach to Atrocity Prevention and Response</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy.</E> As articulated in Presidential Study Directive-10 (PSD-10), preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States. Noting that governmental engagement on mass atrocities and genocide too often arrives too late, when opportunities for prevention or low-cost, low-risk action have been missed, PSD-10 directed the establishment of an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (Board), with the primary purpose of coordinating a whole-of-government approach to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. PSD-10 also directed an interagency study to develop and recommend the membership, mandate, structure, operational protocols, authorities, and support necessary for the Board to coordinate and develop atrocity prevention and response policy. This order continues in place the Board established in 2012 as I directed in PSD-10, sets out the support to be afforded by executive departments, agencies, and offices, and updates and memorializes the terms on which the Board will continue to operate in the service of its important mission.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this order, the term “mass atrocities” or “atrocities,” neither of which is defined under international law, refers to large scale and deliberate attacks on civilians, and includes acts falling within the definition “genocide” as defined in international law and under U.S. domestic statute.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Responsibilities.</E> The Board shall seek to ensure that mass atrocities and the risk thereof are effectively considered and appropriately addressed by the U.S. Government, and shall coordinate the development and execution of policies and tools to enhance our capacity to prevent and respond to mass atrocities.</FP>
  <P>(a) In order to ensure that emerging mass atrocity risks and mass atrocity situations are considered and addressed, the Board shall monitor developments around the world that heighten the risk of mass atrocities, and analyze and closely review specific mass atrocity threats or situations of heightened concern.</P>

  <P>(b) The Board shall also identify any gaps related to the prevention of and response to mass atrocities in the current policies and ongoing interagency processes concerning particular regions or countries and shall make <PRTPAGE P="464"/>recommendations to strengthen policies, programs, resources, and tools related to mass atrocity prevention and response to relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), including through the Board's function as an interagency policy committee, as detailed in section 4 of this order. In these efforts, the Board shall focus in particular on ways for the U.S. Government to develop, strengthen, and enhance its capabilities to:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) monitor, receive early warning of, and coordinate responses to potential mass atrocities;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) deter and isolate perpetrators of mass atrocities through all available and appropriate authorities;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) promote accountability of and deny impunity for perpetrators of mass atrocities, including by denying safe haven for perpetrators found in the United States;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) engage allies and partners, including the United Nations and other multilateral and regional institutions, to build capacity and mobilize action for preventing and responding to mass atrocities;</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13732 of July 1, 2016</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13732</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">United States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of Force</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> United States policy on civilian casualties resulting from U.S. operations involving the use of force in armed conflict or in the exercise of the Nation's inherent right of self-defense is based on our national interests, our values, and our legal obligations. As a Nation, we are steadfastly committed to complying with our obligations under the law of armed conflict, including those that address the protection of civilians, such as the fundamental principles of necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality.</FP>
  <FP>The protection of civilians is fundamentally consistent with the effective, efficient, and decisive use of force in pursuit of U.S. national interests. Minimizing civilian casualties can further mission objectives; help maintain the support of partner governments and vulnerable populations, especially in the conduct of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations; and enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of U.S. operations critical to our national security. As a matter of policy, the United States therefore routinely imposes certain heightened policy standards that are more protective than the requirements of the law of armed conflict that relate to the protection of civilians.</FP>
  <FP>Civilian casualties are a tragic and at times unavoidable consequence of the use of force in situations of armed conflict or in the exercise of a state's inherent right of self-defense. The U.S. Government shall maintain and promote best practices that reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, take appropriate steps when such casualties occur, and draw lessons from our operations to further enhance the protection of civilians.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> In furtherance of U.S. Government efforts to protect civilians in U.S. operations involving the use of force in armed conflict or in the exercise of the Nation's inherent right of self-defense, and with a view toward enhancing such efforts, relevant departments and agencies (agencies) shall continue to take certain measures in present and future operations.</FP>

  <P>(a) In particular, relevant agencies shall, consistent with mission objectives and applicable law, including the law of armed conflict:<PRTPAGE P="500"/>
  </P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) train personnel, commensurate with their responsibilities, on compliance with legal obligations and policy guidance that address the protection of civilians and on implementation of best practices that reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, including through exercises, pre-deployment training, and simulations of complex operational environments that include civilians;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) develop, acquire, and field intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems that, by enabling more accurate battlespace awareness, contribute to the protection of civilians;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) develop, acquire, and field weapon systems and other technological capabilities that further enable the discriminate use of force in different operational contexts;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) take feasible precautions in conducting attacks to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties, such as providing warnings to the civilian population (unless the circumstances do not permit), adjusting the timing of attacks, taking steps to ensure military objectives and civilians are clearly distinguished, and taking other measures appropriate to the circumstances; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(v) conduct assessments that assist in the reduction of civilian casualties by identifying risks to civilians and evaluating efforts to reduce risks to civilians.</FP>
  <P>(b) In addition to the responsibilities above, relevant agencies shall also, as appropriate and consistent with mission objectives and applicable law, including the law of armed conflict:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) review or investigate incidents involving civilian casualties, including by considering relevant and credible information from all available sources, such as other agencies, partner governments, and nongovernmental organizations, and take measures to mitigate the likelihood of future incidents of civilian casualties;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) acknowledge U.S. Government responsibility for civilian casualties and offer condolences, including <E T="03">ex gratia</E> payments, to civilians who are injured or to the families of civilians who are killed;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) engage with foreign partners to share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties, including through appropriate training and assistance; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) maintain channels for engagement with the International Committee of the Red Cross and other nongovernmental organizations that operate in conflict zones and encourage such organizations to assist in efforts to distinguish between military objectives and civilians, including by appropriately marking protected facilities, vehicles, and personnel, and by providing updated information on the locations of such facilities and personnel.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Report on Strikes Undertaken by the U.S. Government Against Terrorist Targets Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.</E> (a) The Director of National Intelligence (DNI), or such other official as the President may designate, shall obtain from relevant agencies information about the number of strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities from January 1, 2016, through December 31, <PRTPAGE P="501"/>2016, as well as assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes, and publicly release an unclassified summary of such information no later than May 1, 2017. By May 1 of each subsequent year, as consistent with the need to protect sources and methods, the DNI shall publicly release a report with the same information for the preceding calendar year.</FP>
  <P>(b) The annual report shall also include information obtained from relevant agencies regarding the general sources of information and methodology used to conduct these assessments and, as feasible and appropriate, shall address the general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike assessments from the U.S. Government and credible reporting from nongovernmental organizations regarding non-combatant deaths resulting from strikes undertaken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities.</P>
  <P>(c) In preparing a report under this section, the DNI shall review relevant and credible post-strike all-source reporting, including such information from nongovernmental sources, for the purpose of ensuring that this reporting is available to and considered by relevant agencies in their assessment of deaths.</P>
  <P>(d) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs may, as appropriate, request that the head of any relevant agency conduct additional reviews related to the intelligence assessments of deaths from strikes against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Periodic Consultation.</E> In furtherance of the policies and practices set forth in this order, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, through the National Security Council staff, will convene agencies with relevant defense, counterterrorism, intelligence, legal, civilian protection, and technology expertise to consult on civilian casualty trends, consider potential improvements to U.S. Government civilian casualty mitigation efforts, and, as appropriate, report to the Deputies and Principals Committees, consistent with Presidential Policy Directive 1 or its successor. Specific incidents will not be considered in this context, and will continue to be examined within relevant chains of command.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) The policies and practices set forth above are not intended to alter, and shall be implemented consistent with, the authority and responsibility of commanders and other U.S. personnel to execute their mission as directed by the President or other appropriate authorities, which necessarily includes the inherent right of self-defense and the maintenance of good order and discipline among U.S. personnel. No part of this order modifies the chain of command of the U.S. Armed Forces or the authority of U.S. commanders.</FP>
  <P>(b) No part of this order modifies priorities in the collection of intelligence or the development, acquisition, or fielding of weapon systems and other technological capabilities.</P>
  <P>(c) No part of this order shall prejudice or supplant established procedures pertaining to administrative or criminal investigative or judicial processes in the context of the military justice system or other applicable law and regulation.</P>

  <P>(d) The policies set forth in this order are consistent with existing U.S. obligations under international law and are not intended to create new <PRTPAGE P="502"/>international legal obligations; nor shall anything in this order be construed to derogate from obligations under applicable law, including the law of armed conflict.</P>
  <P>(e) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.BARACK  ObamaThe White House,</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Amending Executive Order 13675 to Expand Membership on the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote broad-based economic growth and job creation in the United States and Africa by encouraging U.S. companies to trade with and invest in Africa, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy</E>. Recognizing the tremendous potential of expanding the U.S.-Africa commercial relationship, the United States in 2014 launched the Trade Africa Initiative, a partnership between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa, and created a U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa outlining a comprehensive U.S. policy for the region, among other activities. Ensuring that such initiatives and activities reflect the priorities of, and benefit from the support of, the private sector is critical to their success. For that reason, in Executive Order 13675 of August 5, 2014, I directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (Council). Since its establishment in November 2014, the Council has been actively engaged in advising on strengthening commercial engagement between the United States and Africa and has provided numerous recommendations on a broad range of issues. In light of the numerous U.S. Government initiatives and activities to promote expansion of the commercial relationship, the breadth of U.S. private sector engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the range of issues on which future advice may be requested, broader representation of the diversity of private sector viewpoints, experiences, and knowledge on the Council is warranted. Thus I am increasing the membership of the Council.</FP>

Executive Order 13675 of August 5, 2014, is amended in section 3(a) by striking “shall consist of not more than 15 private sector corporate members” and inserting in lieu thereof “shall consist of not more than 26 private sector corporate members”.</FP>

  <EAR>EO 13744</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Coordinating Efforts to Prepare the Nation for Space Weather Events</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to prepare the Nation for space weather events, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy</E>. Space weather events, in the form of solar flares, solar energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances, occur regularly, some with measurable effects on critical infrastructure systems and technologies, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite operations and communication, aviation, and the electrical power grid. Extreme space weather events—those that could significantly degrade critical infrastructure—could disable large portions of the electrical power grid, resulting in cascading failures that would affect key services such as water supply, healthcare, and transportation. Space weather has the potential to simultaneously affect and disrupt health and safety across entire continents. Successfully preparing for space weather events is an all-of-nation endeavor that requires partnerships across governments, emergency managers, academia, the media, the insurance industry, non-profits, and the private sector.</FP>
  <FP>It is the policy of the United States to prepare for space weather events to minimize the extent of economic loss and human hardship. The Federal Government must have (1) the capability to predict and detect a space weather event, (2) the plans and programs necessary to alert the public and private sectors to enable mitigating actions for an impending space weather event, (3) the protection and mitigation plans, protocols, and standards required to reduce risks to critical infrastructure prior to and during a credible threat, and (4) the ability to respond to and recover from the effects of space weather. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) must coordinate their efforts to prepare for the effects of space weather events.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Objectives</E>. This order defines agency roles and responsibilities and directs agencies to take specific actions to prepare the Nation for the hazardous effects of space weather. These activities are to be implemented in conjunction with those identified in the 2015 <E T="03">National Space Weather Action Plan</E> (Action Plan) and any subsequent updates. Implementing this order and the Action Plan will require the Federal Government to work across agencies and to develop, as appropriate, enhanced and innovative partnerships with State, tribal, and local governments; academia; non-profits; the private sector; and international partners. These efforts will enhance national preparedness and speed the creation of a space-weather-ready Nation.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Coordination</E>. (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall coordinate the development and implementation of Federal Government activities to prepare the Nation for space weather events, including the activities established in section 5 of this order and the recommendations of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), established by Executive Order 12881 of November 23, 1993 (Establishment of the National Science and Technology Council).<PRTPAGE P="609"/>
  </FP>

  <P>(b) To ensure accountability for and coordination of research, development, and implementation of activities identified in this order and in the Action Plan, the NSTC shall establish a Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Subcommittee (Subcommittee). The Subcommittee member agencies shall conduct activities to advance the implementation of this order, to achieve the goals identified in the 2015 <E T="03">National Space Weather Strategy</E> and any subsequent updates, and to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the activities specified in the Action Plan and provide subsequent updates.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Roles and Responsibilities</E>. To the extent permitted by law, the agencies below shall adopt the following roles and responsibilities, which are key to ensuring enhanced space weather forecasting, situational awareness, space weather preparedness, and continuous Federal Government operations during and after space weather events.</FP>
  <P>(a) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure the timely provision of operational space weather observations, analyses, forecasts, and other products to support the mission of the Department of Defense and coalition partners, including the provision of alerts and warnings for space weather phenomena that may affect weapons systems, military operations, or the defense of the United States.</P>
  <P>(b) The Secretary of the Interior shall support the research, development, deployment, and operation of capabilities that enhance the understanding of variations of the Earth's magnetic field associated with solar-terrestrial interactions.</P>
  <P>(c) The Secretary of Commerce shall:</P>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) provide timely and accurate operational space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, alerts, and real-time space weather monitoring for the government, civilian, and commercial sectors, exclusive of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense; and</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) ensure the continuous improvement of operational space weather services, utilizing partnerships, as appropriate, with the research community, including academia and the private sector, and relevant agencies to develop, validate, test, and transition space weather observation platforms and models from research to operations and from operations to research.</FP>
  <P>(d) The Secretary of Energy shall facilitate the protection and restoration of the reliability of the electrical power grid during a presidentially declared grid security emergency associated with a geomagnetic disturbance pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824o-1.</P>
  <P>(e) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall:</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Advancing the Goals of the Power Africa Initiative to Expand Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa Through the Establishment of the President's Power Africa Working Group</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the United States to partner, consult, and coordinate with African governments, bilateral and multilateral partners, the private sector, and civil society to expand access to electricity and increase electricity generation in Sub-Saharan Africa, in both urban and rural areas. Through the Power Africa initiative (Power Africa), we aim to double access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa by adding 30,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity and 60 million new household and business connections by 2030, and in so doing, leapfrog to cleaner forms of energy and foster inclusive economic growth and opportunity across Sub-Saharan Africa.</FP>

  <FP>On June 30, 2013, my Administration launched Power Africa, a new initiative to double access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than two-thirds of the population is without electricity, and more than 85 percent of those living in rural areas lack access to electricity. In its initial phase, Power Africa aimed to add more than 10,000 MW of cleaner, more efficient electricity generation capacity and to increase electricity access by at least 20 million new households and commercial entities with on-grid, mini-grid, and off-grid solutions. Power Africa builds on Africa's enormous power potential, including extensive clean geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy resources, as well as vast oil and gas reserves. Power Africa works with countries to develop resources responsibly, build out power generation, transmission, and distribution, and expand the reach of mini-grid and off-grid solutions. Power Africa brings to bear a wide range of tools from across the Federal Government and more than 130 public and private sector partners to support investment in Africa's energy sector. Power Africa provides coordinated support to help African partners expand their power networks and access to electricity, including through policy and regulatory best practices, institutional capacity building, pre-feasibility <PRTPAGE P="614"/>support, grants, long-term financing, insurance, guarantees, credit enhancements, and technical assistance.</FP>
  <FP>On August 5, 2014, during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, my Administration affirmed that Power Africa is intended to reach across Sub-Saharan Africa, and tripled Power Africa's goals. Power Africa is now working toward adding 30,000 MW of new, cleaner electricity generation capacity and increasing electricity access by at least 60 million new connections. On January 28, 2016, my Administration, in coordination with Power Africa partners, launched the Power Africa Roadmap, which lays out a concrete plan for Power Africa to meet its ambitious goals by 2030.</FP>
  <FP>The Electrify Africa Act of 2015, enacted on February 8, 2016 (Public Law 114-121) (the “Act”), calls for the development of a strategy to add at least 20,000 MW of electrical power and promote first-time access to power and power services for at least 50 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 in both urban and rural areas—an effort that directly supports and complements Power Africa's goals. This order furthers the purposes of the Act and the work that Power Africa has been undertaking.</FP>

  <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13748 of November 16, 2016</EXECORDR>
  <EAR>EO 13748</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing a Community Solutions Council</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> Place is a strong determinant of opportunity and well-being. Research shows that the neighborhood in which a child grows up impacts his or her odds of going to college, enjoying good health, and obtaining a lifetime of economic opportunities. Even after 73 consecutive months of total job growth since 2009, communities of persistent poverty remain and for far too many, the odds are stacked against opportunity and achieving the American dream. In addition, between now and 2050, growing our economy, expected population growth, climate change, and demographic shifts will require major new investments in physical, social, and technological infrastructure.</FP>
  <FP>Specific challenges in communities—including crime, access to care, opportunities to pursue quality education, lack of housing options, unemployment, and deteriorating infrastructure—can be met by leveraging Federal assistance and resources. While the Federal Government provides rural, suburban, urban, and tribal communities with significant investments in aid annually, coordinating these investments, as appropriate, across agencies based on locally led visions can more effectively reach communities of greatest need to maximize impact. In recent years, the Federal Government has deepened its engagement with communities, recognizing the critical role of these partnerships in enabling Americans to live healthier and more prosperous lives. Since 2015, the Community Solutions Task Force, comprising executive departments, offices, and agencies (agencies) across the Federal Government, has served as the primary interagency coordinator of agency work to engage with communities to deliver improved outcomes. This order builds on recent work to facilitate inter-agency and community-level collaboration to meet the unique needs of communities in a way that reflects these communities' local assets, economies, geography, size, history, strengths, talent networks, and visions for the future.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Principles.</E> Our effort to modernize the Federal Government's work with communities is rooted in the following principles:</FP>
  <P>(a) A community-driven, locally led vision and long-term plan for clear outcomes should guide individual projects.</P>
  <P>(b) The Federal Government should coordinate its efforts at the Federal, regional, State, local, tribal, and community level, and with cross-sector partners, to offer a more seamless process for communities to access needed support and ensure equitable investments.</P>
  <P>(c) The Federal Government should help communities identify, develop, and share local solutions, rely on data to determine what does and does not work, and harness technology and modern collaboration and engagement methods to help share these solutions and help communities meet their local goals.</P>

  <EAR>EO 13749</EAR>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Providing for the Appointment in the Competitive Service of Certain Employees of the Foreign Service</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> The Federal Government benefits from a workforce that can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates for our highly competitive, merit-based positions. The recruitment and retention of workforce participants who serve in the Foreign Service of the Department of State under a Limited Non-Career Appointment under section 309 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, Public Law 96-465 (22 U.S.C. 3949), as amended, are critical to our ability to meet consular staffing levels (now in substantial deficit) and thereby enhance our capacity to meet high national security standards and efficiently process visas in accordance with our policy of “open doors, safe borders.” Program participants undergo a rigorous merit-based evaluation process, which includes a written test and an oral assessment and to which a veteran preference applies, and develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and in cultural competence in particular regions, skills that are essential for mission-critical positions throughout the entire Federal workforce.</FP>
  <FP>Executive Order 13597 of January 19, 2012, sought to ensure that 80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants be interviewed within three weeks of receiving an application. The Department of State's ability to maintain this 80 percent benchmark will come under increasing pressure in the future given current and projected staffing shortfalls through 2023. These staffing gaps could adversely affect the Department of State's ability to sustain border security and immigration control at peak efficiency and effectiveness, which will have effects on tourism, job creation, and U.S. economic growth. Use of the Limited Non-Career Appointment hiring authority will provide flexibility to address, for the foreseeable future, both this increased demand and recurring institutional and national needs across the Federal Government.</FP>
  <FP>Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that represents all segments of society as provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. The head of any agency in the executive branch may appoint in the competitive service an individual who served for at least 48 months of continuous service in the Foreign Service of the Department of State under a Limited Non-Career Appointment under section 309 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, and who passes such examination as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may prescribe.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. In order to be eligible for noncompetitive appointment to positions under section 2 of this order, such an individual must:<PRTPAGE P="628"/>
  </FP>
  <P>(a) have received a satisfactory or better performance rating (or equivalent) for service under the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment; and</P>
  <P>(b) exercise the eligibility for noncompetitive appointment within a period of 1 year after completion of the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment. Such period may be extended to not more than 3 years in the case of persons who, following such service, are engaged in military service, in the pursuit of studies at an institution of higher learning, or in other activities that, in the view of the appointing authority, warrant an extension of such period. Such period may also be extended to permit the adjudication of a background investigation.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. A person appointed under section 2 of this order shall become a career conditional employee.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. Any law, Executive Order, or regulation that would disqualify an applicant for appointment in the competitive service shall also disqualify a person for appointment under section 2 of this order. Examples of disqualifying criteria include restrictions on employing persons who are not U.S. citizens or nationals, who have violated the anti-nepotism provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(7), 3110, who have knowingly and willfully failed to register for Selective Service when required to do so, 5 U.S.C. 3328(a)(2), who do not meet occupational qualifying standards prescribed by OPM, or who do not meet suitability factors prescribed by OPM.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. The Office of Personnel Management is authorized to issue such additional regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Any individual who meets the terms of this order, however, is eligible for noncompetitive eligibility with or without additional regulations.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>
  <P>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>

Gilman International Scholarship Program, and the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program, all of which are academic exchange programs carried out under the authorities of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87-256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, and the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, title III of Public Law 106-309, would be in the best interest of the Federal Government. Participants in these programs develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and cultural competence in regions that are strategically, diplomatically, and economically important to the United States. It is in the interest of the Federal Government to retain the services of these highly skilled individuals, particularly given that the Federal Government aided them in the acquisition of their skills. Participants in the Fulbright, Gilman, and CLS programs are drawn from highly competitive, merit-based national selection processes to which a veterans' preference applies to ensure that the most qualified individuals are selected.</FP>
  <FP>Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that is drawn from all segments of society as provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.</FP>

Every year, invasive species cost the United States billions of dollars in economic losses and other damages.</FP>
  <FP>Of substantial growing concern are invasive species that are or may be vectors, reservoirs, and causative agents of disease, which threaten human, animal, and plant health. The introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species create the potential for serious public health impacts, especially when considered in the context of changing climate conditions. Climate change influences the establishment, spread, and impacts of invasive species.</FP>
  <FP>Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999 (Invasive Species), called upon executive departments and agencies to take steps to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, and to support efforts to eradicate and control invasive species that are established. Executive Order 13112 also created a coordinating body—the Invasive Species Council, also referred to as the National Invasive Species Council—to oversee implementation of the order, encourage proactive planning and action, develop recommendations for international cooperation, and take other steps to improve the Federal response to invasive species. Past efforts at preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive species demonstrated that collaboration across Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial government; stakeholders; and the private sector is critical to minimizing the spread of invasive species and that coordinated action is necessary to protect the assets and security of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>This order amends Executive Order 13112 and directs actions to continue coordinated Federal prevention and control efforts related to invasive species. This order maintains the National Invasive Species Council (Council) and the Invasive Species Advisory Committee; expands the membership of the Council; clarifies the operations of the Council; incorporates considerations of human and environmental health, climate change, technological innovation, and other emerging priorities into Federal efforts to address invasive species; and strengthens coordinated, cost-efficient Federal action.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience</HD>

  <FP>By the authority vested in me as the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Purpose.</E> As recognized in Executive Order 13689 of January 21, 2015, (Enhancing Coordination of National Efforts in the Arctic), Arctic environmental stewardship is in the national interest. In furtherance of this principle, and as articulated in the March 10, 2016, U.S.-Canada Joint Statement on Climate, Energy, and Arctic Leadership, the United States has resolved to confront the challenges of a changing Arctic by working to conserve Arctic biodiversity; support and engage Alaska Native tribes; incorporate traditional knowledge into decisionmaking; and build a sustainable Arctic economy that relies on the highest safety and environmental standards, including adherence to national climate goals. The United States is committed to achieving these goals in partnership with indigenous communities and through science-based decisionmaking. This order carries forth that vision in the northern Bering Sea region.<PRTPAGE P="640"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The Bering Sea and Bering Strait are home to numerous subsistence communities, rich indigenous cultures, and unique marine ecosystems, each of which plays an important role in maintaining regional resilience. The changing climate and rising average temperatures are reducing the occurrence of sea ice; changing the conditions for fishing, hunting, and subsistence whaling; and opening new navigable routes to increased ship traffic. The preservation of a healthy and resilient Bering ecosystem, including its migratory pathways, habitat, and breeding grounds, is essential for the survival of marine mammals, fish, seabirds, other wildlife, and the subsistence communities that depend on them. These communities possess a unique understanding of the Arctic ecosystem, and their traditional knowledge should serve as an important resource to inform Federal decisionmaking.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It shall be the policy of the United States to enhance the resilience of the northern Bering Sea region by conserving the region's ecosystem, including those natural resources that provide important cultural and subsistence value and services to the people of the region. For the purpose of carrying out the specific directives provided herein, this order delineates an area hereafter referred to as the “Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area,” in which the exercise of relevant authorities shall be coordinated among all executive departments and agencies (agencies). All agencies charged with regulating, overseeing, or conducting activities in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area shall do so with attention to the rights, needs, and knowledge of Alaska Native tribes; the delicate and unique ecosystem; the protection of marine mammals, fish, seabirds, and other wildlife; and with appropriate coordination with the State of Alaska.</FP>
  <FP>The boundary of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area includes waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone bounded to the north by the seaward boundary of the Bering Straits Native Corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the south by the southern boundaries of the Northern Bering Sea Research Area, the St. Matthew Habitat Conservation Area, and the Nunivak-Kuskokwim Habitat Conservation Area; and to the west by the maritime boundary delimited by the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Maritime Boundary, signed at Washington, June 1, 1990.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Withdrawal.</E> Under the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing for a time period without specific expiration the following areas of the Outer Continental Shelf: (1) the area currently designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as the Norton Basin Planning Area; and (2) the Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area lying within 25 nautical miles of St. Lawrence Island. The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are more specifically delineated in the attached map and, with respect to the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area, the accompanying table of withdrawn Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks. Both the map and table form a part of this order, with the table governing the withdrawal and withdrawal boundaries within the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area. This withdrawal prevents consideration of these areas for future oil or gas leasing for purposes of exploration, development, or production. This withdrawal furthers the principles of responsible public <PRTPAGE P="641"/>stewardship entrusted to this office and takes due consideration of the importance of the withdrawn area to Alaska Native tribes, wildlife, and wildlife habitat, and the need for regional resiliency in the face of climate change. Nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area.</E> (a) There is established a Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area (Bering Task Force), under the Arctic Executive Steering Committee (AESC) established in Executive Order 13689, to be co-chaired by an office of the Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard.</FP>
  <P>(b) The membership of the Bering Task Force (member agencies) shall include, in addition to the Co-Chairs, designated senior-level representatives from:</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Smart Gun Technology</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[, and] the Secretary of Homeland Security</HD>
  
  <FP>For more than 20 years, the Federal Government has worked to keep guns out of the wrong hands through background checks. This critical effort in addressing gun violence has prevented more than two million prohibited firearms purchases from being completed. But tens of thousands of people are still injured or killed by firearms every year—in many cases by guns that were sold legally but then stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. Developing and promoting technology that would help prevent these tragedies is an urgent priority.</FP>
  
  <FP>In 2013, I directed the Department of Justice to review the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies, such as devices requiring a scan of the owner's fingerprint before a gun can fire. In its report, the Department made clear that technological advancements in this area could help reduce accidental deaths and the use of stolen guns in criminal activities.</FP>
  

  <FP>Millions of dollars have already been invested to support research into a broad range of concepts for improving gun safety. We must all do our part to continue to advance this research and encourage its practical application, and it is possible to do so in a way that makes the public safer and is consistent with the Second Amendment. The Federal Government has a <PRTPAGE P="664"/>unique opportunity to do so, as it is the single largest purchaser of firearms in the country. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Research and Development.</E> The Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security (departments) shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that would reduce the frequency of accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms, and improve the tracing of lost or stolen guns. Not later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare jointly a report outlining a research and development strategy designed to expedite the real-world deployment of such technology for use in practice.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Department Consideration of New Technology.</E> The departments shall, to the extent permitted by law, regularly (a) review the availability of the technology described in section 1, and (b) explore potential ways to further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety. In connection with these efforts, the departments shall consult with other agencies that acquire firearms and take appropriate steps to consider whether including such technology in specifications for acquisition of firearms would be consistent with operational needs.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>
  <P>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>

  <FP>On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four additional persons who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. On February 16, 2005, by Executive Order 13372, the President clarified the steps taken in Executive Order 12947.</FP>

  <FP>These terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national <PRTPAGE P="666"/>emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>Cancer is a leading cause of death, and cancer incidence is expected to increase worldwide in the coming decades. But today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs. It is of critical national importance that we accelerate progress towards prevention, treatment, and a cure—to double the rate of progress in the fight against cancer—and put ourselves on a path to achieve in just 5 years research and treatment gains that otherwise might take a decade or more. To that end, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force.</E> There is established, within the Office of the Vice President, a White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force (Task Force), which will focus on making the most of Federal investments, targeted incentives, private sector efforts from industry and philanthropy, patient engagement initiatives, and other mechanisms to support cancer research and enable progress in treatment and care. The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.</FP>
  <P>(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice President, the Task Force shall consist of the heads of the executive branch departments, agencies, and offices listed below:</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in or in Relation to Côte d'Ivoire</HD>
  <FP>On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, the President declared a national emergency, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire. The situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire, which has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 of November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, significant political violence and unrest, and fatal attacks against international peacekeeping forces.</FP>
  <FP>The Government of Côte d'Ivoire and its people continue to make significant progress in promotion of democratic, social, and economic development. We congratulate Côte d'Ivoire on holding a peaceful and credible presidential election, which represents an important milestone on the country's road to full recovery. The United States also supports the advancement of national reconciliation and impartial justice in Côte d'Ivoire. The United States is committed to helping Côte d'Ivoire strengthen its democracy and stay on the path of peaceful democratic transition, and we look forward to working with the Government and people of Côte d'Ivoire to ensure continued progress and lasting peace for all Ivoirians.</FP>

  <FP>While the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and its people continue to make progress towards consolidating democratic gains and peace and prosperity, the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 7, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond February 7, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396.<PRTPAGE P="670"/>

  <FP>On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, who took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates if those assets were not protected. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability.<PRTPAGE P="671"/>

  <FP>The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and we need to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuse by certain members of Qadhafi's family and other former regime officials.</FP>
  <FP>For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2016.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing by the Federal Government</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>A growing body of evidence suggests that the overuse of solitary confinement and other forms of restrictive housing in U.S. correctional systems undermines public safety and is contrary to our Nation's values.</FP>
  <FP>In July 2015, as part of my Administration's ongoing efforts to pursue reforms that make the criminal justice system more fair and effective, I directed the Attorney General to undertake a comprehensive review of the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons. Since that time, senior officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) have met regularly to study the issue and develop strategies for reducing the use of this practice nationwide.</FP>
  <FP>Those efforts gave rise to a final report transmitted to me on January 25, 2016 (DOJ Report and Recommendations Concerning the Use of Restrictive Housing) (the “DOJ Report”), that sets forth specific policy recommendations for DOJ with respect to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other DOJ entities as well as more general guiding principles for all correctional systems.</FP>
  <FP>As the DOJ Report makes clear, although occasions exist when correctional officials have no choice but to segregate inmates from the general population, this action has the potential to cause serious, long-lasting harm. The DOJ Report accordingly emphasizes the responsibility of Government to ensure that this practice is limited, applied with constraints, and used only as a measure of last resort.</FP>

  <FP>Given the urgency and importance of this issue, it is critical that DOJ accelerate efforts to reduce the number of Federal inmates and detainees held in restrictive housing and that Federal correctional and detention systems be models for facilities across the United States. Therefore, by the authority <PRTPAGE P="672"/>vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to address the overuse of solitary confinement in correctional and detention systems throughout the United States, I hereby direct as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Implementation of the DOJ Report.</E> (a) DOJ shall promptly undertake to revise its regulations and policies, consistent with the direction of the Attorney General, to implement the policy recommendations in the DOJ Report concerning the use of restrictive housing. DOJ shall provide me with an update on the status of these efforts not later than 180 days after the date of this memorandum.</FP>
  <P>(b) Other executive departments and agencies (agencies) that impose restrictive housing shall review the DOJ Report to determine whether corresponding changes at their facilities should be made in light of the policy recommendations and guiding principles in the DOJ Report.</P>
  <FP>These other agencies shall report back to me not later than 180 days after the date of this memorandum on how they plan to address their use of restrictive housing.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</FP>

  <FP>On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the <PRTPAGE P="673"/>actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
  <FP>On March 16, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13661, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
  <FP>On March 20, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
  <FP>On December 19, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13685, to take additional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.</FP>
  <FP>The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2014, and the measures adopted on that date, on March 16, 2014, on March 20, 2014, and December 19, 2014, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2016.

  <FP>On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain persons, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. These actions and policies had contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in <PRTPAGE P="674"/>Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability in the southern African region.</FP>
  <FP>On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, including the blocking of the property of additional persons engaged in undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.</FP>
  <FP>On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 and authorized the blocking of the property of additional persons who were engaged in undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, facilitating public corruption by senior officials, or were responsible for committing human rights abuses related to political repression.</FP>
  <FP>The actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2016.

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran</HD>
  <FP>On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959, imposing comprehensive sanctions on Iran to further respond to this threat. On August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying the previous orders. I took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010, Executive Order 13574 of May 23, 2011, Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011, Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012, Executive Order 13622 of July 30, 2012, Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012, and Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013.</FP>
  <FP>On July 14, 2015, the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the European Union, and Iran reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful. January 16, 2016, marked Implementation Day under the JCPOA, when the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report verifying that Iran had completed key nuclear-related steps as specified in the JCPOA, and the Secretary of State confirmed the report's findings. As a result, the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions on Iran consistent with its commitments under the JCPOA, including the termination of a number of Executive Orders that were issued pursuant to this national emergency. Though the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions constitutes a significant change in our sanctions posture, non-nuclear related sanctions remain in place.</FP>

  <FP>Despite the historic deal to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, certain actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12957. The emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive <PRTPAGE P="676"/>Order 12170. This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2015.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Building National Capabilities for Long-Term Drought Resilience</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
    <E T="03">Purpose</E>. Our Nation must sustain and expand efforts to reduce the vulnerability of communities to the impacts of drought. Every year, drought affects millions of Americans and poses a serious and growing threat to the security and economies of communities nationwide. Drought presents challenges to the viability of agricultural production and to the quantity and quality of drinking water supplies that communities and industries depend upon. Drought jeopardizes the integrity of critical infrastructure, causes extensive economic and health impacts, harms ecosystems, and increases energy costs. In responding to and recovering from past droughts, we have learned that focused collaboration across all levels of government and the private sector is critical to enable productive and workable solutions to build regional resilience to drought.</FP>

  <FP>Among other actions, this memorandum institutionalizes the National Drought Resilience Partnership (NDRP), which builds upon the National Integrated Drought Information System, an interagency program led by the Department of Commerce. The NDRP was outlined in the President's Climate Action Plan to better coordinate Federal support for drought-related <PRTPAGE P="680"/>efforts, help communities reduce the impact of current drought events, and prepare for future droughts. In sustaining this focused collaboration, the NDRP will provide the Federal Government with a lasting platform that enables locally and regionally driven priorities and needs to guide coordinated Federal activities.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
    <E T="03">Policy</E>. It is the policy of the Federal Government to coordinate and use applicable Federal investments, assets, and expertise to promote drought resilience and complement drought preparedness, planning, and implementation efforts of State, regional, tribal, and local institutions. In addition, where appropriate, the Federal Government shall seek partnerships with such institutions and the private sector in order to increase and diversify our Nation's water resources through the development and deployment of new technologies and improved access to alternative water supplies. Agencies shall also work with State, regional, tribal, and local institutions to support their efforts to maintain and enhance the long-term health and resilience of working lands and ecosystems. In carrying out this memorandum, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall continue to recognize the primacy of States, regions, tribes, and local water users in building their resilience to drought.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E>
    <E T="03">Drought Resilience Goals</E>. (a) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent possible, carry out the policy described in section 2 of this memorandum by implementing policies and taking actions to achieve the following drought resilience goals:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) <E T="03">Data Collection and Integration</E>. Agencies shall share data and information related to drought, water use, and water availability, including data on snowpack, groundwater, stream flow, and soil moisture with State, regional, tribal, and local officials to strengthen decisionmaking to support more adaptive responses to drought and drought risk.</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) <E T="03">Communicating Drought Risk to Critical Infrastructure</E>. Agencies shall communicate with State, regional, tribal, local, and critical infrastructure officials, targeted information about drought risks, including specific risks to critical infrastructure.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>My Administration has made behavioral health a priority and taken a number of steps to improve the prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders. These actions are especially important in light of the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic as well as the suicide and substance use-related fatalities that have reversed increases in longevity in certain populations. One important response has been the expansion and implementation of mental health and substance use disorder parity protections to ensure that coverage for these benefits is comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care. The Affordable Care Act builds on the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to expand mental health and substance use disorder benefits and Federal parity protections for more than 60 million Americans. To realize the promise of coverage expansion and parity protections in helping individuals with mental health and substance use disorders, executive departments and agencies need to work together to ensure that Americans are benefiting from the Federal parity protections the law intends. To that end, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force.</E> There is established an interagency Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force (Task Force), which will identify and promote best practices for executive departments and agencies (agencies), as well as State agencies, to better ensure compliance with and implementation of requirements related to mental health and substance use disorder parity, and determine areas that would benefit from further guidance. The Director of the Domestic Policy Council shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.</FP>

  <FP>On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, I declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have repeatedly been the subject of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.</FP>

  <FP>On July 20, 2012, I issued Executive Order 13620 to take additional steps to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536, in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2036 of February 22, 2012, and Resolution 2002 of July 29, 2011, and to address: exports of charcoal from Somalia, which generate significant revenue for al-Shabaab; the <PRTPAGE P="689"/>misappropriation of Somali public assets; and certain acts of violence committed against civilians in Somalia, all of which contribute to the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia.</FP>
  <FP>Because the situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on April 12, 2010, and the measures adopted on that date and on July 20, 2012, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond April 12, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Formerly Incarcerated Individuals</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>America is a Nation of second chances. Promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals who have paid their debt to society makes communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assists those who return from prison, jail, or juvenile justice facilities to become productive citizens; and saves taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration. Policies that limit opportunities for people with criminal records create barriers to employment, education, housing, health care, and civic participation. This lack of opportunity decreases public safety, increases costs to society, and tears at the fabric of our Nation's communities.</FP>
  <FP>Reducing the cycle of incarceration and recidivism requires coordinated action by government at all levels. Estimates are that as many as 70 million or more Americans have a record of arrest, criminal adjudication, or conviction. Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from Federal and State correctional facilities. Millions more are released each year from local jails. In many cases, a criminal record is an obstacle to obtaining employment or a license related to or necessary for employment. However, many individuals have criminal histories that should not automatically disqualify them from employment or licensing, but should instead be examined as part of a review of the person as a whole. Providing incarcerated individuals with job and life skills, education programming, and mental health and addiction treatment increases the likelihood that such individuals will be successful when released. And removing barriers to successful reentry helps formerly incarcerated individuals compete for jobs, attain stable housing, and support their families. All of these are critical to reducing recidivism and strengthening communities.</FP>
  <FP>In 2011, the Attorney General formed the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, a Cabinet-level working group dedicated to the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails. I am issuing this memorandum to ensure that the Federal Government continues the important work of this council and builds on its successes.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Actions of the Government of Syria</HD>
  <FP>On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13338, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, E.O. 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in E.O. 13399 of April 25, 2006, E.O. 13460 of February 13, 2008, E.O. 13572 of April 29, 2011, E.O. 13573 of May 18, 2011, E.O. 13582 of August 17, 2011, E.O. 13606 of April 22, 2012, and E.O. 13608 of May 1, 2012.</FP>

  <FP>The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.<PRTPAGE P="694"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also is generating instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical and biological weapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to function effectively, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in E.O. 13338; on April 25, 2006, in E.O. 13399; on February 13, 2008, in E.O. 13460; on April 29, 2011, in E.O. 13572; on May 18, 2011, in E.O. 13573; on August 17, 2011, in E.O. 13582; on April 22, 2012, in E.O. 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in E.O. 13608; must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.</FP>
  <FP>In addition, the United States condemns the Asad regime's use of brutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Asad regime to stop its violence against the Syrian people, uphold the Cessation of Hostilities, enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and allow a political transition in Syria that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice.</FP>
  <FP>The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.</FP>

However, consistent with U.S. commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States is no longer pursuing efforts to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The United States action to fulfill these commitments became effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which occurred once the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented key nuclear-related steps specified in the JCPOA to ensure that its nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other Persons to Undermine Belarus's Democratic Processes or Institutions</HD>
  <FP>On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections, to commit human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances, and to engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.</FP>
  <FP>The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.</FP>

  <PNOTICE>Notice of June 21, 2016</PNOTICE>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea</HD>
  <FP>On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.</FP>

  <FP>On August 30, 2010, I signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea <PRTPAGE P="703"/>Navy ship <E T="03">Cheonan</E> and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.</FP>

  <FP>On April 18, 2011, I signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that will ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</FP>
  <FP>On January 2, 2015, I signed Executive Order 13687 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as expanded in Executive Order 13551, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570, to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses.</FP>
  <FP>On March 15, 2016, I signed Executive Order 13722 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. Executive Order 13722 also implements certain multilateral sanctions imposed under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270.</FP>

  <FP>The existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, addressed further in Executive Order 13570, further expanded in scope in Executive Order 13687, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016, and the measures taken to deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in Executive Order 13466.<PRTPAGE P="704"/>

  <FP>The actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans, including acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

  <FP>The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems.

  <DETNO>Presidential Determination No. 2016-10 of September 12, 2016</DETNO>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2017</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</HD>
  <FP>Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.</FP>
  <FP>A country's presence on the foregoing Major Drug Transit and Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries List is not a reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has carried out the most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures.</FP>
  <FP>Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included in this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B). Explanations for these decisions are published with this determination.</FP>
  <FP>I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Burma and Venezuela is vital to the national interests of the United States.</FP>
  <FP>In addition to emphasizing the importance of international cooperation, this determination highlights a number of recent developments concerning various aspects associated with the worldwide drug problem.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Growing Consensus on International Narcotics</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>There is a growing international consensus that counternarcotics programs must be designed and implemented with the aim of improving the health and safety of individuals while preventing and reducing violence and other harmful consequences to communities.</FP>

  <FP>In concert with international partners, the United States is expanding its domestic and international funding for drug treatment and recovery support programs based on empirical scientific evidence that shows that substance use disorders are medical conditions and must be treated as such. To achieve greater balance, U.S. drug policy also includes stepped-up promotion of effective alternative development programs for farmers and others who agree to stop illegal drug cultivation and associated activities. Such <PRTPAGE P="715"/>efforts also focus on advancing the rule of law through improving and strengthening civil and law enforcement institutions. United States polices support overall citizen security, including deepening worldwide adherence to fundamental human rights guaranteed by international law.</FP>
  <FP>This consensus was demonstrated at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) held on April 19-21, 2016, in New York. The meeting served as the first high-level, global gathering on counternarcotics in a generation, and its resulting outcome document forged international consensus behind a balanced and pragmatic approach to drug control. A central theme of UNGASS was to further develop and implement strategies based on the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) 2009 Political Declaration and Action Plan aimed at reducing drug production, trafficking, and use from the standpoint of effective public health practices. UNGASS participants, including the United States, also highlighted the importance of substantive advancement of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which for the first time in history incorporates rule of law objectives into global development policy.</FP>
  <FP>UNGASS further underscored the broad consensus among United Nations member states with regard to many major drug control themes. At the special session, member states demonstrated their common cause to reinforce efforts to counter drug cultivation, production, distribution, and use through pragmatic approaches that balance both law enforcement and public health perspectives. As stated by the UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), we have a “common obligation to employ effective drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of our citizens.” Participants also reaffirmed their ongoing commitment to the 1961, 1971, and 1988 UN conventions on drugs as the essential backdrop for worldwide drug control efforts. These conventions leave sufficient room for individual states to pursue drug policies that are in accord with their own laws and national realities.</FP>
  <FP>The foreign policy approaches to drug control of the United States are explained in detail in the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy, and our policies and programs are designed to help reach the goals established at UNGASS and work effectively with partners around the world. They include, for example, on going bilateral cooperation and collaborative work through numerous regional and sub-regional multilateral organizations such as the Organization of American States; the European Union; regional affiliates of the global Financial Action Task Force; the Economic Community of West African States; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; and many others. The United States also joins other nations in supporting the important, positive contributions of many nongovernmental organizations in the academic and private sectors that work on improving counternarcotics policies and programs.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Growing Challenges of Heroin Use, Adulterants, and Opium Poppy Cultivation</E>
  </FP>

  <FP>According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the use of heroin and other opium poppy derivatives is the greatest worldwide drug problem today. Heroin is also the greatest drug threat in the United States, according to the 2015 U.S. National Drug Threat Assessment published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Especially dangerous is the increasing adulteration of heroin with synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, <PRTPAGE P="716"/>leading to an increase in the number of deaths as the result of drug overdoses. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 10,500 Americans died from heroin-related overdoses; the true number likely is higher given inconsistent testing across the States.</FP>
  <FP>Opium poppy cultivation is expanding beyond Afghanistan, Burma, and Laos the traditional primary producing countries in the world. While Afghanistan is still the major supplier of opium derivatives to Europe and Canada, nearly all opium derivatives found in the United States are primarily grown in or trafficked through Mexico or by Mexican-based drug trafficking organizations. In Mexico, for example, international officials estimate that the number of hectares of heroin poppy under cultivation increased from 11,000 hectares in 2013 to as much as 28,000 hectares in 2015. Limited poppy cultivation also has been detected in Colombia and Guatemala.</FP>
  <FP>According to UNODC, 201,000 hectares of opium poppy were cultivated in Afghanistan in 2015, a 5 percent decline from 2014. Comparative data shows, however, that while cultivation and yields declined relative to previous years, cultivation is still at historically high levels.</FP>
  <FP>The 2016 U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy indicates that insurgent groups in Afghanistan generate significant revenue by taxing drugs passing through regions they control. Afghan government drug control efforts are hampered by broad security challenges associated with intensive, long-term conflict and combat. The U.S. Government continues to support a broad range of multilateral and bilateral drug control programs in Afghanistan.</FP>
  <FP>Although many treatment and recovery facilities established in Afghanistan show great promise, the 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey conducted by the Department of State and the Afghan Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board found an 11 percent drug positive rate in Afghanistan. Use of heroin and other opium poppy products, according to international analysis, is also significant in Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The INCB is also concerned about the increasing use of Afghan sourced heroin throughout the Middle East.</FP>

  <FP>Heroin in the United States is being increasingly adulterated with low-cost synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl. Research has shown that fentanyl and its analogues can be 25 to 50 times more potent than heroin. According to U.S. law enforcement, most illicit fentanyl, precursors, and fentanyl analogues that have been identified in the United States originate in China and enter the country via Mexico, Canada, or direct mail. The United States has taken a number of steps to address this issue. The United States is working with Mexico and Canada to develop bilateral and multilateral approaches to combating opioid production and trafficking, particularly heroin and fentanyl. Law enforcement cooperation with Mexico includes programs to strengthen Mexico's capacity to identify, investigate, interdict and dismantle clandestine drug laboratories and disrupt trafficking networks. The United States conducts regular and positive discussions with China to enhance controls on many chemicals used to make fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. In a welcome development in late 2015, China placed controls on 116 substances including a dangerous analogue to fentanyl, acetyl <PRTPAGE P="717"/>fentanyl. Much work remains to be done in this area, and developing compatible, consistent, enforceable international standards is crucial to successfully controlling this growing drug threat.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Cocaine and Coca Cultivation</E>
  </FP>
  <FP>Although international and U.S. surveys indicate overall production of coca leaf for cocaine has remained stable from a decade ago, Colombia has seen a 42 percent increase in illegal coca crop cultivation from 2014 to 2015. Colombia remains the major provider of cocaine available in the United States, though data shows that cocaine use is declining in the United States and in Europe. Nevertheless, U.S. rates of overdose involving cocaine were up in 2014.</FP>
  <FP>Increased Colombian coca cultivation can be attributed to a number of factors, including Colombia's decision to end the aerial coca eradication program in October 2015 throughout the country. Even prior to the end of spray eradication, coca growers began to implement “counter” eradication techniques, such as by migrating their plantings to areas where spray was not permitted by law or policy. Illegal coca cultivators also began to cultivate smaller, better concealed fields to avoid detection by law enforcement. Colombia has reformulated its counternarcotics strategy to prioritize robust law enforcement activity against criminal drug trafficking organizations, including enhanced interdiction, over that of crop eradication. In 2015, the country seized 295 metric tons of cocaine along with other illegal drugs.</FP>
  <FP>To reach the United States, cocaine is primarily trafficked by land, air, and sea via Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Over the past decade, roughly 97 percent of U.S. bound cocaine is smuggled out of South America on noncommercial maritime conveyances. Smaller amounts are smuggled via commercial maritime vessels and noncommercial aircraft. Using similar conveyances, cocaine destined for Europe is often routed through Brazil, Bolivia, and Venezuela, as well as via West Africa.</FP>
  <FP>Numerous large shipping containers have been interdicted on Atlantic routes, sometimes with a first stop in Portuguese speaking countries in Africa. Using these routes reduces language barriers before the drugs are smuggled to their final destination. A variety of U.S. assistance programs, especially those designed to enhance national interdiction capabilities and target kingpin traffickers, are carried out in Africa.</FP>
  <FP>United States assistance programs are designed to disrupt the flow of cocaine and other harmful products to the United States by building the capacity of judicial, law enforcement, and treatment institutions in partner countries. For example, in Central America these programs are carried out through the Central America Regional Security Initiative, while those in the Caribbean are conducted through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. The Merida Initiative provides the framework for assistance and bilateral cooperation with Mexico. Key activities of these programs include drug interdiction cooperation, especially maritime-based efforts in Central America and the Caribbean; law enforcement capacity building; anticorruption initiatives and support; and enhanced prosecution and judicial reform strengthening efforts.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Looking to the Future</E>
    <PRTPAGE P="718"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Future action by the international community to address drug cultivation, production, trafficking, and use should be closely tied to the important priorities described in the 2016 UNGASS outcome document. These include, for example, utilization of sound scientific evidence for prevention and treatment programs, effective law enforcement, and appropriately balanced responses to drug-related crime. Areas of special concern include the connections between drug use and human rights, especially as they pertain to vulnerable groups such as women and children. The exchange of information among nations and between professionals engaged in reducing drug trafficking and use, and efforts to stay ahead of new and threatening developments, such as synthetic substances, are central to progress by communities, countries, and regions around the world.</FP>
  <FP>The U.S. Government will continue to work with fellow United Nations member states to galvanize the international community toward implementation of the principles that were agreed upon at the 2016 UNGASS. General coordination among concerned United Nations entities is particularly important. This includes collaboration among bodies within the UN structure as a whole, but particularly those that concern themselves to some extent with drug control and related social issues.</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>Our greatest asset in protecting the homeland and advancing our interests abroad is the talent and diversity of our national security workforce. Under my Administration, we have made important progress toward harnessing the extraordinary range of backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, skills, and experiences of the U.S. population toward keeping our country safe and strong. As the United States becomes more diverse and the challenges we face more complex, we must continue to invest in policies to recruit, retain, and develop the best and brightest from all segments of our population. Research has shown that diverse groups are more effective at problem solving than homogeneous groups, and policies that promote diversity and inclusion will enhance our ability to draw from the broadest possible pool of talent, solve our toughest challenges, maximize employee engagement and innovation, and lead by example by setting a high standard for providing access to opportunity to all segments of our society.</FP>

  <FP>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide guidance to the national security workforce in order to strengthen the talent and diversity of their respective organizations. That workforce, which comprises more than 3 million people, includes the following departments, agencies, offices, and <PRTPAGE P="727"/>other entities (agencies) that are primarily engaged in diplomacy, development, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security: 1) Department of State: Civil Service and Foreign Service; 2) United States Agency for International Development (USAID): Civil Service and Foreign Service; 3) Department of Defense (DOD): commissioned officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian personnel; 4) the 17 members of the Intelligence Community; 5) Department of the Treasury: Office of International Affairs and Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection; 6) Department of Justice: National Security Division and Federal Bureau of Investigation; and 7) Department of Homeland Security.</FP>
  <FP>The data collected by these agencies do not capture the full range of diversity in the national security workforce, but where data allow for broad comparison, they indicate that agencies in this workforce are less diverse on average than the rest of the Federal Government. For example, as of 2015, only the Department of State and USAID Civil Services were more diverse in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity than the Federal workforce as a whole. When comparing the agencies' workforces to their leadership personnel (Senior Executive Service (SES) or its equivalent), all agencies' leadership staffs were less diverse than their respective workforces in terms of gender, and all but DOD enlisted personnel and USAID Civil Service had less diverse leadership in terms of race and ethnicity. While these data do not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunity, we can do more to promote diversity in the national security workforce, consistent with merit system principles and applicable law.</FP>
  <FP>When I issued Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce), I directed all departments and agencies to develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion. This memorandum supports that effort by providing guidance that 1) emphasizes a data-driven approach in order to increase transparency and accountability at all levels; 2) takes into account leading practices, research, and experience from the private and public sectors; and 3) complements ongoing actions that agencies are taking pursuant to Executive Order 13583 and under the leadership of the Diversity and Inclusion in Government Council, including but not limited to efforts related to gender, race, ethnicity, disability status, veterans, sexual orientation and gender identity, and other demographic categories. This memorandum also supports Executive Order 13714 of December 15, 2015 (Strengthening the Senior Executive Service), by directing agencies to take additional steps to expand the pipeline of diverse talent into senior positions.</FP>
  <FP>This memorandum also aligns with congressional efforts to promote the diversity of the national security workforce, which have been reflected in legislation such as the:</FP>
  <P>• <E T="04">Foreign Service Act of 1980</E>, which urged the Department of State to develop policies to encourage the “entry into and advancement in the Foreign Service by persons from all segments of American society”;</P>
  <P>• <E T="04">Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004</E>, which called on the Intelligence Community to prescribe personnel policies and programs that ensure its personnel “are sufficiently diverse for purposes of the collection and analysis of intelligence through the recruitment and <PRTPAGE P="728"/>training of women, minorities, and individuals with diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds”; and</P>
  <P>• <E T="04">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013</E>, which mandated that the U.S. military develop and implement a plan to accurately measure the efforts of the military to “achieve a dynamic, sustainable level of members of the armed forces (including reserve components) that, among both commissioned officers and senior enlisted personnel of each armed force, will reflect the diverse population of the United States eligible to serve in the armed forces, including gender specific, racial, and ethnic populations.”</P>
  <FP>Promoting diversity and inclusion within the national security workforce must be a joint effort and requires engagement by senior leadership, managers, and the entire workforce, as well as effective collaboration among those responsible for human resources, equal employment opportunity, and diversity and inclusion issues. In implementing the guidance in this memorandum, agencies shall ensure their diversity and inclusion practices are fully integrated into broader succession planning efforts and supported by sufficient resource allocations and effective programs that invest in personnel development and engagement. Where appropriate, they shall also support, coordinate, and encourage research and other efforts by the Federal Government to expand the knowledge base of best practices for broadening participation and understanding the impact of diversity and inclusion on national security, including in the fields of science and technology.</FP>
  <FP>Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination of Workforce Data.</E> Although collected data do not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunity, the collection and analysis of metrics allows agencies to assess their workforce talent gaps, as well as the effectiveness of their diversity and inclusion efforts and the adequacy of their resources to address these gaps. The dissemination of data to the public and to agency personnel may increase the transparency and accountability of their efforts. Accordingly, agencies in the national security workforce shall:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Make aggregate demographic data and other information available to the public and broader workforce.</E> Agencies shall make available to the general public information on the state of diversity and inclusion in their workforces. That information, which shall be updated at least once a year, shall include aggregate demographic data by workforce or service and grade or rank; attrition and promotion demographic data; validated inclusion metrics such as the New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) index score; demographic comparisons to the relevant civilian labor force; and unclassified reports and barrier analyses related to diversity and inclusion. Agencies may publish data in proportions or percentages to account for classification concerns, and the Intelligence Community may publish a community-wide report with the data outlined in this section. In addition, agencies shall provide to their workforces, including senior leadership at the Secretary or Director level, a report that includes demographic data and information on the status of diversity and inclusion efforts no later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum and on an annual basis thereafter (or in line with existing annual reporting requirements related to these issues, if any).<PRTPAGE P="729"/>
  </P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Expand the collection and analysis of voluntary applicant flow data.</E> Applicant flow data tracks the selection rate variances for job positions among different demographic categories and can assist agencies in examining the fairness and inclusiveness of their recruitment efforts. Agencies shall develop a system to collect and analyze applicant flow data for as many positions as practicable in order to identify future areas for improvement in attracting diverse talent, with particular attention to senior and management positions. The collection of data may be implemented in a phased approach commensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall include such analysis, including the percentage and level of positions for which data are collected, and any resulting policy changes or recommendations in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Identify additional categories for voluntary data collection of current employees.</E> The Federal Government provides minimum reporting categories for agencies collecting race and ethnicity information in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive “Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.” That standard also encourages agencies to collect more detailed data, which can be compared by aggregating such data into minimum categories when necessary. Further, agencies may also collect additional demographic data, such as information regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. No later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum, agencies shall determine whether they recommend the voluntary collection of more detailed demographic data on additional categories. This process shall involve close consultation with internal stakeholders, such as employee resource or affinity groups; clear communication with the workforce to explain the purpose of, legal protections related to, and anticipated use of such data; and adherence to relevant standards and guidance issued by the Federal Government. Any determinations shall be submitted to OMB, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Department of Labor for consideration.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Provision of Professional Development Opportunities and Tools Consistent with Merit System Principles.</E> An inclusive work environment enhances agencies' ability to retain and sustain a strong workforce by allowing all employees to perform at their full potential and maximize their talent. Professional development opportunities and tools are key to fostering that potential, and each agency should make it a priority to ensure that all employees have access to them consistent with merit system principles. Agencies in the national security workforce shall therefore:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Conduct stay and exit interviews or surveys.</E> Agencies shall conduct periodic interviews with a representative cross-section of personnel to understand their reasons for staying with their organization, as well as to receive feedback on workplace policies, professional development opportunities, and other issues affecting their decision to remain. They shall also provide an opportunity for exit interviews or surveys of all departing personnel to understand better their reasons for leaving. Agencies shall include analysis from the interviews and surveys—including if and how the results of the interviews differ by gender, race and national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, and other demographic variables—and any resulting policy changes or recommendations in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.<PRTPAGE P="730"/>
  </P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Expand provision of professional development and career advancement opportunities.</E> Agencies shall prioritize resources to expand professional development opportunities that support mission needs, such as academic programs, private-public exchanges, and detail assignments to relevant positions in private or international organizations; State, local, and tribal governments; or other branches of the Federal Government. In addition, agencies in the national security workforce shall offer, or sponsor employees to participate in, an SES Candidate Development Program (CDP) or other programs that train employees to gain the skills required for senior-level agency appointments. In determining which employees are granted professional development or career advancement opportunities, agencies shall ensure their SES CDP comports with the provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 412, subpart C, including merit staffing and assessment requirements. Agencies shall also consider the number of expected senior-level vacancies as a factor in determining the number of candidates to select for such programs. Agencies shall track the demographics of program participants as well as the rate of placement into senior-level positions for participants in such programs, evaluate such data on an annual basis to look for ways to improve outreach and recruitment for these programs consistent with merit system principles, and include such data in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.</P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Institute a review process for security and counterintelligence determinations that result in assignment restrictions.</E> For agencies in the national security workforce that place assignment restrictions on personnel or otherwise prohibit certain geographic assignments due to a security determination, these agencies shall ensure a review process exists consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, as well as applicable counterintelligence considerations. Agencies shall ensure that affected personnel are informed of the right to seek review and the process for doing so.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Strengthening of Leadership Engagement and Accountability.</E> Senior leadership and supervisors play an important role in fostering diversity and inclusion in the workforce they lead and in setting an example for cultivating talent consistent with merit system principles. Toward that end, agencies in the national security workforce shall:</FP>
  <P>(a) <E T="03">Reward and recognize efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.</E> Agencies are strongly encouraged to consider implementing performance and advancement requirements that reward and recognize senior leaders' and supervisors' efforts in fostering an inclusive environment and cultivating talent consistent with merit system principles, such as through participation in mentoring programs or sponsorship initiatives, recruitment events, and other opportunities. They are also encouraged to create opportunities for senior leadership and supervisors to participate in outreach events and to discuss issues related to diversity and inclusion with the workforce on a regular basis, including with employee resource groups.</P>
  <P>(b) <E T="03">Collect and disseminate voluntary demographic data of external advisory committees and boards.</E> For agencies in the national security workforce that have external advisory committees or boards to which their senior leadership appoints members, they are strongly encouraged to collect voluntary demographic data from the members of committee and boards, and to include such data in the information and report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.<PRTPAGE P="731"/>
  </P>
  <P>(c) <E T="03">Expand training on unconscious bias, inclusion, and flexible work policies.</E> Agencies shall expand their provision of training on implicit or unconscious bias, inclusion, and flexible work policies and make implicit or unconscious bias training mandatory for senior leadership and management positions, as well as for those responsible for outreach, recruitment, hiring, career development, promotion, and security clearance adjudication. The provision of training may be implemented in a phased approach commensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall also make available training for bureaus, directorates, or divisions whose inclusion scores, such as those measured by the New IQ index, consistently rank below the agency-wide average 3 or more years in a row. Agencies should give special attention to ensuring the continuous incorporation of research-based best practices, including those to address the intersectionality between certain demographics and job positions.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Reporting on Progress.</E> No later than 120 days after the date of this memorandum, and on an annual basis thereafter, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, in consultation with the Directors of OMB and OPM, shall report to the President on the progress of the national security workforce in implementing the requirements of this memorandum, based on information provided by relevant departments and agencies.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>
  <P>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law, and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>
  <P>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burundi</HD>
  <FP>On November 22, 2015, by Executive Order 13712, I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in Burundi, which has been marked by the killing of and violence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of imminent violence, and significant political repression, and which threatens the peace, security, and stability of Burundi.</FP>
  <FP>The situation in Burundi continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 22, 2015, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond November 22, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712.</FP>

However, consistent with U.S. commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States is no longer pursuing efforts to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The United States action to fulfill these commitments became effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which occurred once the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented key nuclear-related steps specified in the JCPOA to ensure that its nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful.</FP>

The U.S. business of Aixtron consists of AIXTRON, Inc., a California corporation, the equity interests of AIXTRON, Inc., and any asset of Aixtron or AIXTRON, Inc. used in, or owned for the use in or benefit of, the activities in interstate commerce in <PRTPAGE P="738"/>the United States of AIXTRON, Inc., including without limitation any interest in any patents issued by, and any interest in any patent applications pending with, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (collectively, Aixtron US); and</P>

  <P>(b) In order to effectuate this order, the Purchasers and Aixtron shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed acquisition of Aixtron US not later than 30 days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for a period not to exceed 90 days, on such written conditions as CFIUS may require. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed acquisition of Aixtron US, the Purchasers and Aixtron shall certify in writing to CFIUS that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed acquisition of Aixtron US have been completed.</P>

  <HD SOURCE="HED"> Steps for Increased Legal and Policy Transparency Concerning the United States Use of Military Force and Related National Security Operations</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>Since my earliest days in office, I have emphasized the importance of transparency and my commitment to making as much information as possible available to the Congress and the public about the United States use of military force and related national security operations. Doing so, I believe, not only supports the process of democratic decision making, but also demonstrates the legitimacy and strengthens the sustainability of our operations while promoting mutual understanding with our allies and partners.</FP>

  <FP>The United States has used military force and conducted related national security operations within legal and policy frameworks that are designed to ensure that such operations are lawful and effective and that they serve our interests and values. Consistent with my commitment to transparency, my Administration has provided to the public an unprecedented amount of information regarding these frameworks through speeches, public statements, reports, and other materials. We have attempted to explain, consistent with our national security and the proper functioning of the executive branch, when and why the United States conducts such operations, the legal basis and policy parameters for such operations, and how such operations have unfolded, so that the American people can better understand them.<PRTPAGE P="740"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>In addition to the efforts we have made to date, there is still more work that can be done to inform the public. Thus, consistent with my Administration's previous efforts, by this memorandum I am directing national security departments and agencies to take additional steps to share with the public further information relating to the legal and policy frameworks within which the United States uses military force and conducts related national security operations. Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows:</FP>

  <HD SOURCE="HED">Supporting New American Service Members, Veterans, and Their Families</HD>
  <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
  <FP>My Administration has maintained a steadfast commitment to honor and serve the brave men and women who have served this country. Like all service members and veterans, foreign-born residents and naturalized citizens serving in the United States Armed Forces are shining examples of the American dream. These brave new Americans have taken the extraordinary step of answering the call to duty, to support and defend our country. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country before becoming American citizens.</FP>

  <FP>New American service members are undoubtedly a critical element of our national security. They risk their lives all over the world in the name of the United States, securing shipping lanes, protecting bases and embassies, providing medical assistance, and conducting humanitarian missions. Tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents and naturalized U.S. citizens currently serve in our Armed Forces. Many more are veterans who have served previously in the Armed Forces. Additionally, many U.S.-born service members have immediate family members who were born abroad.<PRTPAGE P="742"/>
  </FP>
  <FP>Over the past decade, the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security have strengthened partnerships to provide services and opportunities to service members, veterans, and their families interacting with the U.S. immigration system. Indeed, since 2001, more than 110,000 service members have been naturalized and many were assisted in the process through partnerships such as the “Naturalization at Basic Training Initiative,” which gives non-citizen enlistees the opportunity to naturalize during basic training. Despite these efforts, service members, veterans, and their families still face barriers to accessing immigration benefits and other assistance for which they may be eligible.</FP>
  <FP>In light of the sacrifices that all of these individuals make and have made for our country, it is critical that executive departments and agencies (agencies) enhance collaboration and streamline processes to ensure that they receive the services and benefits they need and have earned. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to address the issues facing new American service members, veterans, and their families, I hereby direct as follows:</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Interagency Working Group to Support New American Service Members, Veterans, and their Families.</E> There is established a Working Group to Support New American Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (Working Group) to coordinate records, benefits, and immigration and citizenship services for these service members, veterans, and their families. The Working Group shall convene its first meeting within 10 days of the date of this memorandum.</FP>

  <P>(b) The Working Group shall consult with additional agencies or offices, as appropriate.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Mission and Functions of the Working Group.</E> (a) The Working Group shall coordinate agency efforts to support service members, veterans, and their families who are navigating the immigration, veterans, and military systems. Such efforts shall include:</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) coordinating the sharing of military records and other information relevant to immigration or veterans benefits;</FP>
  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) enhancing awareness of naturalization and immigration benefits to provide timely assistance and information to service members, veterans, and their families;</FP>

  <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) other efforts that further support service members, veterans, and their families.<PRTPAGE P="743"/>
  </FP>
  <P>(b) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Working Group shall develop an initial 3-year strategic action plan that details broad approaches to be taken to enhance access to services and benefits. This initial plan shall be supplemented by a more detailed plan, to be published within 120 days of the date of this memorandum that discusses the steps to be taken in greater detail. The Working Group shall also report periodically on its accomplishments and ongoing initiatives.</P>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Outreach.</E> Consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and applicable law, the Working Group shall seek the views of representatives of private and nonprofit organizations; veterans and military service organizations; State, tribal, and local government agencies; elected officials; and other interested persons to inform the Working Group's plans.</FP>
  <FP>
    <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Working Group, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Working Group. Each agency and office shall bear its own expense for carrying out activities related to the Working Group.</FP>
  <P>(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority granted by law to an executive department or an agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government.</P>
  <P>(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>
  <P>(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>

        <P>(3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would—</P>
        <P>(i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps.</P>

        <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 102.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 102.150</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
        <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

        <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 102.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result <PRTPAGE P="757"/>in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
        <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
        <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
        <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
        <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
        <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
        <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

        <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
        <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
        <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
        <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
        <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
        <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
        <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 102.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

        <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers <PRTPAGE P="759"/>Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.</P>
        <P>(g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—</P>
